"Title": "Outcomes of Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia on Insomnia, Depression, and Fatigue for Individuals with Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Series",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This clinical case series examined outcomes of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Current literature links insomnia with higher rates of depression and fatigue in individuals with MS. However, no research to date evaluates a targeted psychotherapeutic intervention for insomnia in this population. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Eleven individuals with a diagnosis of MS and insomnia participated in individual or group-based CBT-I sessions at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center between 2008 and 2013. A medical record review examined these individuals' self-reported experiences of insomnia, depression, and fatigue at the preintervention and postintervention levels using the Insomnia Severity Index, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Total sleep time was also reported at pretreatment and posttreatment intervals. RESULTS: Overall, participants reported improvements regarding insomnia, fatigue, and depression after CBT-I. Total sleep time also increased by an average of 1.5 hours. Despite overall improvement, symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, and depression persisted, at varying levels, for most participants. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that CBT-I may serve as an effective clinical intervention for individuals with MS who report symptoms of insomnia. Given the considerable overlap of experiences of insomnia, depression, and fatigue in people with MS, CBT-I may also be helpful in identifying areas that may require additional clinical intervention for persistent symptoms of depression and fatigue. Further research is necessary.",

"Title": "Managing fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis-patients' experiences, developing and piloting a fatigue management programme",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is a major complaint in many people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Lack of physical activity, negative thinking, symptom focussing, depression and inability to cope with stress may perpetuate fatigue. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown to be effective in reducing MS-related fatigue. Aims: Our goal was to develop and pilot a short patient education programme tailored to match patients' rehab schedules. Methods: We performed individual interviews (n=4) and one focus group interview (n=12) with MS patients regarding characteristics of fatigue as well as wishes and requirements for a CBT programme. Based on these findings and an already existing manual we developed a 3-week CBT group programme consisting of six sessions. The programme was highly standardized and manualised with ppt-slides and moderator cards. We piloted the intervention in 3 groups of MS patients (n=16) within a rehabilitation centre. Groups consisted of 5-6 participants. We used the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functioning (FSMC), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES) to test for changes in fatigue, depression and perceived ability to manage given challenges. Outcomes were assessed before and directly after the intervention. Participants were also asked about general acceptance, satisfaction with the programme, perceived learning effect and programme's feasibility. Results: Interview analyses showed that that fatigue affects patients very differently and that patients use different strategies in coping with fatigue in daily life. Patients showed great interest in learning more about the origins of MS-related fatigue as well as ways of managing fatigue more effectively. The pilot study showed a significant improvement on the CSES after the intervention (before=71.5; after=84.0; p=0.13, n=16; range 13-130). No significant improvements were found for fatigue and depression. All participants took part in all 6 sessions of the programme. Overall, participants were very satisfied with the programme's content and duration as well as their perceived learning progress concerning coping with fatigue. Conclusions: This study supports the further development of a standardized group-based behavioural programme suitable for the rehabilitation setting aiming to change fatigue-enhancing patterns and cognitions. However, a larger sample is needed to prove effectivity. Standardisation may enable MS nurses or social workers to perform the training which has to be shown in further studies.",

"Title": "Treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients: a neurocognitive approach",
"Abstract": "The objective of the study was to treat fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) by a neurocognitive rehabilitation program aimed at improving motor planning by using motor imagery (MI). Twenty patients with clinically definite MS complaining of fatigue were treated for five weeks with exercises of neurocognitive rehabilitation twice a week. Patients were evaluated by Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), MSQoL54, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and MS Functional Composite (MSFC). After treatment, a decrease in fatigue was detected with both FSS (P = 0.0001) and MFIS (P = 0.0001). MSFC (P = 0.035) and MSQoL54 (P = 0.002) scores improved compared to baseline. At six-month followup, the improvement was confirmed for fatigue (FSS, P = 0.0001; MFIS P = 0.01) and for the physical subscale of MSQoL54 (P = 0.049). No differences in disability scales were found. These results show that neurocognitive rehabilitation, based on MI, could be a strategy to treat fatigue in MS patients.",

"Title": "Managing Neuropsychological Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis: Pilot Study on a Standardized Metacognitive Intervention",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system of potential autoimmune origin that is frequently associated with psychological disorders and cognitive deficits, as well as with fatigue, stress, and psychosocial burden. These factors often cause decreased quality of life, social withdrawal, and unemployment. We describe the development of a cognitive-behavioral group intervention based on the concept of metacognition and evaluation of the feasibility and acceptance of the program as a rehabilitation tool. METHODS: Metacognitive Training in MS (MaTiMS) consists of six modules, each 90 minutes in duration. We tested acceptance and design of the program in six focus groups (entire sample, n = 27). Framework analysis of transcripts was used to identify key topics and categories. Program modules were revised in accordance with appropriate recommendations of focus group members. We subsequently evaluated MaTiMS in two groups (n = 5, n = 6) in a rehabilitation center. Neuropsychological functioning as well as coping self-efficacy, depression, stress, perceived cognitive deficit, fatigue, and quality of life were assessed. Acceptance of MaTiMS from the patient perspective was also studied. RESULTS: The modules were highly accepted by patients. Pre-post assessments showed significant improvements in the Coping Self Efficacy Scale (P = .007), the WÃƒÂ¼rzburger Fatigue Inventory for MS Score (P = .028), and the Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis Mood subscale (P = .046). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that MaTiMS represents a feasible psychological group training program that may foster improvements in self-efficacy, fatigue, and mood. The next step will be an evaluation of the program in a randomized controlled trial.",

"Title": "Predictors and impact of the working alliance in the neuropsychological rehabilitation of patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: There is preliminary evidence of positive effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether a working alliance affects rehabilitation outcome has not been studied. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the baseline patient-related (cognitive, mood and fatigue symptoms, cognitive status, demographic factors) and illness-related factors (duration and severity of the disease) on the alliance, as well as the effects of the alliance on rehabilitation outcome in neuropsychological rehabilitation among MS patients. Methods: Fifty-six patients with relapsing-remitting MS received multimodal neuropsychological intervention (attention retraining, learning strategies, psychoeducation, psychological support, homework assignments) conducted once a week in 60-minute sessions for thirteen consecutive weeks. After the intervention, both patients and therapists evaluated the alliance with the short form of the Working Alliance Inventory. Results: None of the baseline factors was related to the alliance. Better patient-evaluated alliance was associated with a more prominent decrease in fatigue symptoms and greater achievement of rehabilitation goals. Better therapist-evaluated alliance was associated with greater benefit from the intervention as evaluated by therapists. Conclusion: A positive patient-therapist alliance may relate to positive neuropsychological rehabilitation outcome in MS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",

"Title": "A modified version of a UK group-based fatigue management programme for people with MS (FACETS) for an inpatient setting in Norway",
"Abstract": "Background: FACETS (Fatigue: Applying Cognitive behavioral and Energy effectiveness Techniques to lifestyle) is a 6-week group-based fatigue management outpatient programme developed in the UK for people with MS (pwMS) that has demonstrated effectiveness in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Aims: i. to translate FACETS into Norwegian; ii. modify the 6-week outpatient group programme into an inpatient programme; iii. assess preliminary feasibility and acceptability. Methods: The facilitator manual was translated by a UK translation company. The participant workbook and PowerPoint materials were translated by two occupational therapists and a physiotherapist at MS-Senteret Hakadal (MSSH). Subsequent cultural and institutional transadaption of all programme materials was undertaken at MSSH. The modified group programme was tried out in the rehabilitation setting over a 6-month period. A final modified version was feasibility tested in a small pre-post pilot study (n=11) involving delivering two FACETS groups. Content, duration and usefulness was assessed by an evaluation questionnaire incorporating open questions. The Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ) and Fatigue Self-Efficacy Scale (FSE) were administered pre- and post-programme. Results: The modified version includes four sessions with Ã¢â‚¬Å“homeworkÃ¢â‚¬Â between sessions. Participants were content with the group format and facilitation and liked the homework. Participation did not adversely affect other desired rehabilitation activities. Reported benefits included normalisation of fatigue, greater awareness of energy use and of ways to rest. Participants highly valued the peer support element and the opportunity to learn new fatigue management strategies. Mean differences (MD) for the CFQ (baseline M=22.36; SD=6.25; MD=10.09 [95% CI: 5.13, 15.05], p = .001) and the FSE (baseline M=40; SD=12; MD=-20 [95% CI: -27, -12], p < .001) indicated improvements. Conclusion: The modified version of FACETS appears feasible and acceptable. While only a small uncontrolled study, preliminary findings suggest FACETS offers promise in an inpatient rehabilitation setting with further research warranted.",

"Title": "A pilot study of an exercise-based patient education program in people with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "There is increasing evidence that physical exercise leads to numerous positive effects in PwMS. However, long-term effects of exercise may only be achievable if training is implemented in daily routine. Enabling patients to exercise regularly, we developed a patient education program focused on evidence-based information of training. PwMS were educated in neurophysiological effects of physical exercise, exercise-induced benefits for PwMS, and risk factors (e.g., weather). Fifteen PwMS were analyzed before (T 0) and after (T 1) a 12-week patient education. Afterwards, participants performed their exercises autonomously for 32 weeks and were tested in sustainability tests (T 2). Guided interviews were carried out, additionally. Significant improvements from T 0 to T 1 were found in 6MWT, gait velocity, TUG, fatigue, and quality of life. Significant results of TUG and gait velocity from T 1 to T 2 demonstrated that participants kept few effects after the 32-week training phase. Qualitative analyses showed improved self-confidence and identified training strategies and barriers. This pilot study provides evidence that PwMS are able to acquire good knowledge about physical exercise and apply this knowledge successfully in training management. One might conclude that this exercise-based patient education seems to be a feasible option to maintain or improve patients' integral constitution concerning physical and mental health.",

"Title": "Development and feasibility of the Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (HOPE) self-management intervention for people living with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe the development and feasibility of a self-management intervention called the Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (HOPE: MS), aimed at improving the physical and psychological wellbeing of people living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). METHOD: HOPE: MS is an innovative, 6-week group-based, manualised self-management intervention combining positive psychology theory and practice, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Participants (N=21) recruited via a local East Midlands branch of the MS Society attended one of three HOPE: MS interventions and completed self-reported outcome measures in week 1 and week 6. The following outcome measures were used: The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale; Multiple Sclerosis Fatigue Severity Scale; The Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale; The Adult State Hope Scale; The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; The Positive and Negative Affect Scale. RESULTS: Post-intervention (6 weeks) mean scores decreased in the physical impact (baseline M=65.6, SD=17.4; 6 weeks M=55.1, SD=17.9, 95% CI [-4.39, -16.47] and the psychological impact of MS (baseline M=24.0, SD=7.3; 6 weeks M=18.9; SD=6.3, 95% CI [-2.54, -7.66]). There was also a decrease mean fatigue severity scores (baseline 49.4, SD=13.3, 6 weeks M=41.1, SD=14.4, 95% CI [-2.65, -13.44]). There was a mean decrease in depression scores (baseline M=6.9, SD=3.5; 6 weeks M=4.2, SD=2.8, 95% CI [-1.43, -4.00]). There were smaller mean decreases in anxiety (baseline M=7.6, SD=3.4; 6 weeks M=6.7 (4.0), 95% CI [0.69, -2.50]) and negative affect (baseline M=22.9, SD=6.8; 6 weeks M=20.8 (8.1), 95% CI [0.69, -2.50]) refer Table 3 ). Mean MS self-efficacy scores (baseline 21.7, SD=4.2; 6 weeks M=24.1, SD=4.7, 95% CI [0.23, 4.53]), mean total hope scores (baseline M=23.3, SD=10.7; 6 weeks M=32.2 (10.6), 95% CI [4.91, 12.9]), hope agency scores (baseline M=10.5, SD=5.7; 6 weeks M=15.7 (6.2), 95% CI [2.37, 8.01]), hope pathways (baseline M=12.9, SD=6.0; 6 weeks M=16.6 (4.9), 95% CI [2.00, 5.43]) and positive affect scores increased (baseline M=27.3, SD=7.1; 6 months M=32.2, SD=8.4, 95% CI [0.42, 9.39]). Participants positively rated the intervention quality and delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study showed that the HOPE: MS was acceptable and useful to people living with MS. Further robust evaluations using a randomised controlled trial design with longer follow ups are needed to confirm early promising results of the HOPE: MS. Implications for rehabilitation Living with MS requires constant adjustments to cope with unpredictable symptoms. Self-management interventions have the potential to help people living with MS to improve their quality of life. A feasibility study of the HOPE: MS self-management group-based intervention showed that it was acceptable and useful to people living with MS.",

"Title": "Outcomes from the canterbury fatigue programme for people with multiple sclerosis: A mixed method feasibility study",
"Abstract": "Background: New Zealand (NZ) has a high prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS). Of all its symptoms, fatigue is correlated with higher levels of disability, depression and interference with activities of daily life. Recent research has demonstrated efficacy for managing fatigue via group based self- management programmes. The lack of such a programme in NZ prompted the development of the 'Canterbury Fatigue Programme'. The programme is offered in small groups over 6 weeks delivered by a trained health professional. It covers a range of topics and aims to improve the individual's management of fatigue using the principles of self-management (education, reflection and development of self-efficacy and strategies for behaviour change). Purpose: This mixed method feasibility study evaluated the efficacy and acceptability of the Canterbury Fatigue Programme for people with MS. Methods: Twenty-five adults (with MS of any type) were recruited via advertisement in MS newsletters or word of mouth from five sites throughout NZ to attend the programme. All consented to participate in this study. Data collection entailed (i) completion of the MS Selfefficacy Scale (MSSES) and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) at one month prior to the programme commencement (T1), at programme commencement (T2) and at completion (T3), and (ii) telephone interviews one month and three months after the end of the programme. Outcomes of the two scales were compared at each time point via paired t-tests and interviews were analysed thematically. Results: All attendees were female (mean age 49, range 37-63), 64% had relapsing remitting MS with a wide spread of time since diagnosis (less than a year to 40 years). The MSSES was stable between T1 (one month prior to programme commencement) and T2 (at programme commencement) (p = .54, two-tailed). There was however strong evidence for change between T2 (at programme commencement) and T3 (at programme completion) (p = .006, two-tailed). The mean change in score of 8.55 (95% CI, -14.40 to -2.70) had a large effect size. The MFIS also demonstrated stability between T1 and T2 (p = .69, twotailed), with strong evidence for change between T2 and T3 (p = .001, two-tailed). The mean decrease in MFIS score was 2.12 (95% CI, 0.99 to 3.25), which again was a large effect size. Four inter-related themes were evident in the interviews: (a) facilitators and barriers to behaviour change; (b) the importance of the group setting; (c) achievement of personal behaviour change; and (d) life as a whole. Conclusion(s): This study has demonstrated that the Canterbury Fatigue Programme facilitated behaviour change and had a positive effect not only on fatigue and self-efficacy, but on life as a whole. This study also revealed the barriers and facilitators to be considered for future delivery of the programme. Implications: This study demonstrates efficacy of the Canterbury Fatigue Programme for the management of fatigue by people with MS in NZ. Further validation will be necessary for it to be generalizable in other countries.",

"Abstract": "Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) often suffer from psychological distress and cognitive dysfunctioning. These factors negatively impact the health-related quality of life. Only recently behavioral therapeutic approaches are being used to treat psychological distress in MS. The aim of the present pilot study was not only to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological distress but also to explore whether it can improve cognitive functioning among patients with MS. Outpatients of the MS Center of the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) were invited to participate in an MBSR training. Psychological and cognitive measures were administered pre- and post-intervention. Twenty-five MS patients completed the MBSR training and psychological measures, of which 16 patients completed the cognitive tests. Significant improvements were found in depressive symptoms, quality of life, fatigue, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Of the cognitive tests, performance on a visual spatial processing test significantly improved after the intervention. Overall, this pilot study showed promising results of the effects of MBSR on reducing psychological distress, and it suggests MBSR might improve cognitive functioning in MS patients. Future randomized controlled trials should be conducted to confirm the possible effectiveness of MBSR-and its long-term effects-on psychological and cognitive functioning in MS patients.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To modify and pilot test a face-to-face group energy conservation education program for delivery by group telephone teleconference to people with multiple sclerosis. PARTICIPANTS: 29 community dwelling individuals with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: The first phase of the study involved the modification of an existing energy conservation education program to accommodate teleconference delivery. The second phase involved a pilot test of the intervention using a basic pre/post intervention design. Licensed occupational therapists delivered the intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Fatigue severity, fatigue impact, health related quality of life, self-efficacy for performing energy conservation strategies, and use of energy conservation behaviors. FINDINGS: Using an a priori alpha of p = 0.10, paired t-tests found significant reductions in fatigue severity, fatigue impact, and improvements in the following aspects of quality of life: bodily pain and general health. Average effect size was 0.31. The most used energy conservation strategies after the course were simplifying activities, adjusting priorities, changing body position, resting, and planning the day to balance work and rest. CONCLUSION: The pilot study supports on-going development and testing of energy conservation education delivered by teleconference to people with multiple sclerosis.",

"Title": "Evaluation of the effect of progressive relaxation exercises on fatigue and sleep quality in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fatigue and sleep problems are very commonly observed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique (PMRT), used as one of the alternative methods in recent years, is reported to have benefits such as facilitating sleep and reducing sensitivity against fatigue. This research was conducted to investigate the effect of PMRT on fatigue and sleep quality in patients with MS. SETTING AND DESIGN: This research was performed as a single-group pretest/post-test pretrial model. The research was conducted between March 2008 and December 2009 in the neurology polyclinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted with 32 patients who met the research criteria and agreed to participate in the study. A Personal Information Form was used as a data collection tool, Fatigue Severity Scale was used for measuring fatigue, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used for evaluating the sleep quality. PMRT was applied to the sample group once a day for 6 weeks. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Percentage, paired t-test, and Pearson's correlation analysis were used in the assessment of data. RESULTS: It was determined that PMRT decreased patients' fatigue level and improved their sleep quality, and this difference was observed to be statistically significant. Moreover, patients' fatigue level increased as their sleep quality decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the effect of PMRT on fatigue and sleep quality in patients with MS, and it is recommended that further studies be conducted on this subject in the future.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fatigue management and energy conservation are effective strategies to minimize fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). Sustained results have not yet been reported. METHODS: A fatigue management course was provided for 32 MS patients. They were tested prior to, directly after participation in the course and in a 7-9 month follow-up with the Fatigue Severity Scale, the MS-specific Fatigue Scale, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a self-rating scale for depression. The Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) and the MS functional composite (MSFC) were evaluated before and after participation in the course. RESULTS: The total score and the Cognitive and Physical subscores of the MFIS showed significant improvements on both points of time. Scores in the Fatigue Severity Scale, MS-specific Fatigue Scale and Psychosocial Fatigue Impact Scale did not improve significantly. MS functional composite and EDSS remained unchanged after six weeks of course participation. Subjective sleep quality improved directly after participation in the course and after 7-9 months. The depression score decreased significantly to a normal level at the end of training and in the 7-9 month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Fatigue management enables MS patients to cope with their fatigue and energy more effectively. Follow-up evaluations showed stable results after 7-9 months.",

"Title": "Improved fatigue in individuals with multiple sclerosis after participating in a short-term self-care programme",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is among the most common, yet least understood symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The debilitating symptoms of MS can have adverse effects on the sufferer's self-esteem. We report the effect of a short-term self-managed graded exercise programme on fatigue and self-esteem of patients with MS. METHODS: Thirty-four (age range: 20-50, mean: 29.7 years; M:F 0.7:1.0) patients with MS who lived in Tehran and were not physically disabled entered the study. Self-esteem score was measured with the Persian translation of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Fatigue was evaluated with a visual analogue scale. The patients performed the self-managed techniques for 6 weeks. Self-esteem and fatigue were evaluated once more after the self-managed graded exercise programme. RESULTS: On paired sample test, the self-esteem score of the patients was significantly different before (53.9) and after (68.1) the self-managed graded exercise programme (P<0.0001). The score of fatigue was also significantly different before (4.59) and after (5.76) the intervention (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study can provide us with important insights into our understanding of the potential for developing self-care training as an alternative in rehabilitation of the patients with MS. Self-managed graded exercise programme may be considered as an alternative to direct nursing services for patients with MS.",

"Title": "An interactive, self-guided fatigue management education resource: Changing knowledge, expectations and behaviours",
"Abstract": "Background: Seventy to 90% of people with MS experience fatigue. To manage fatigue effectively, the patient needs to be fully engaged in the treatment process. This can be done through selfmanagement support - helping patients understand the central role they play in managing their illness. Available fatigue management interventions do support self-management but usually require involvement in a structured programme. These programmes may not be accessible or consistent with patients' preferred learning styles or the particular factors contributing to their fatigue. An interactive, self-guided fatigue management education resource has the potential to address this problem. Our team developed such a resource, which allows people with MS to take a personalized and active approach to learning about and managing their fatigue. Aims: A pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of the interactive, self-guided fatigue management resource for persons with MS. An interim analysis was conducted to determine how a subgroup of persons with MS have experienced the use of the resource. Methods: The pilot study recruited persons with MS from two sites in Canada (N=35). The primary criterion for eligibility was a fatigue severity scale score of 2.0-5.4 (i.e. mild to moderate fatigue). The study involved three primary data collection points: baseline, 3 weeks and 3 months. The qualitative data from a subgroup of individuals, 10, who had completed all three data collection assessments, were analyzed using interpretive description analysis. Results: Use of the fatigue management resource over 3 months facilitated changes in: (1) knowledge - clearer thinking, less frustration and normalization of the fatigue experience; (2) expectations - trust in self, and less worry and fear; and (3) behaviours - achieving important tasks and goals. Participants reported overall improved quality of life, increased self-confidence, and better communication with others. Conclusions: Interim results suggest that this resource holds strong potential to be an effective and valuable fatigue self-management support tool for persons with MS. Data collection for the entire sample is nearing completion, and continuing qualitative analyses indicate that findings are consistent with interim results. Self-guided fatigue management tools such as our resource can aid to achieve successful outcomes when added to established treatment strategies for MS fatigue.",

"Title": "Effects of an 1-day education program on physical functioning, activity and quality of life in community living persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persons with MS (pwMS) in the community show reduced physical activity while studies demonstrated beneficial effects of exercise therapy in supervised settings. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated, in pwMS living in the community, the effects of a 1-day education program about exercises and sports, on physical activity behavior and related outcome measures as self-efficacy, perceived walking ability, fatigue, perceived impact of MS and quality of life. METHODS: PwMS attended an education day with theoretical and practical sessions that was organized by the Flemish MS Society and professional exercise experts. Forty-two participants immediately completed questionnaires as well as after three and six months. Overall disability and physical activity level were measured using PDSS (patient determined disease steps) and PASIPD (Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities) respectively. Other outcomes were the ESES, MSWS-12, MFIS, MSIS-29 and SF-36. Analyses of variance were performed in groups distinguished by self-reported disability level (PDDS <=1; n = 24 and PDSS >1; n = 18). RESULTS: Groups differed significantly for perceived walking ability (PDDS,MSWS-12) and physical related-domains of MSIS-29 and SF-36, but not PASIPD. A trend towards significant group*time interaction effect was found for the PASIPD indicating, at 3 and 6 months, increased physical activity in the subgroup PDDS <=1. For the MSIS-29, a significant time effect was found with reduced impact being largest for the more disabled group at 6 months. No changes were found in other outcome measures. CONCLUSION: An one-day education program had, depending on perceived disability level, some long-standing effects on physical activity and perceived impact of MS.",

"Title": "Evaluation of change in fatigue, self-efficacy and health-related quality of life, after a group educational intervention programme for persons with neuromuscular diseases or multiple sclerosis: a pilot study",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: An intervention for persons with neuromuscular diseases (NMD) or multiple sclerosis (MS) who experienced severe fatigue was developed which aimed at educating participants in maintaining a balance between capacity and load in their daily activities. This pilot study evaluated the results of this intervention. METHODS: Persons with NMD or MS who experienced severe fatigue were included. Outcome measures were: fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), health-related quality of life (HRQoL; SF-36) and self-efficacy (ALCOS-16). Changes in scores between the start of the intervention (T0) and 3 months post-intervention (T1) were tested with the Wilcoxon tests in the complete group and in subgroups (gender, education, high/low self-efficacy). RESULTS: Forty-three persons participated. Significant improvements of HRQoL were found for the domains role-physical, mental health and general health perceptions. Subgroup analyses showed more improvement in males (fatigue, role-physical, vitality, bodily pain, general health perceptions), participants with lower education (role-physical, vitality) and participants with low self-efficacy at T0 (self-efficacy, mental health, general health perceptions) than in females, participants with higher education and participants with higher initial self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: This pilot-study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a group educational intervention in improving HRQoL without increasing fatigue in persons with NMD and MS.",

"Title": "The effects of self-care training on quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive disease of the central nervous system with debilitating symptoms and complications. Therefore, education and appropriate interventions, including self-care education, are necessary to increase the quality of life in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of self-care education on quality of life in MS patients affiliated to Iranian MS Association. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental study assessed a single group of MS patients before and after training. Totally, 50 MS patients were selected non-randomly from the patients referring to Iranian MS Association. A two-part questionnaire was used to collect data. The first part included demographic information and the second part consisted of a quality of life questionnaire (MSQOL-54) including 54 items in 3 sections and 14 subgroups. The scores ranges from zero to a hundred in each subgroup. The reliability of the questionnaire has been confirmed (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96). The questionnaires were filled out by the patients before training. After at least six 50-minute training sessions during three months, the same questionnaire was again completed by the participants. Statistical analyses, including absolute and relative frequency tables and mean and standard deviation for descriptive analysis, and t-test and Pearson correlation for descriptive analysis, were performed by SPSS. FINDINGS: The mean values of quality of life in physical health, pain, fatigue, health conception, changes in health status, sexual activities, as well as overall quality of life scores differed significantly after training. Moreover, except for cognitive activity, there were significant differences in values of mental health before and after training. CONCLUSIONS: Designing and applying the self-care programs based on the educational needs of MS patients has a positive effect on physical and psychological aspects of their quality of life.",

"Title": "The interactive web-based program MSmonitor for self-management and multidisciplinary care in multiple sclerosis: concept, content, and pilot results",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a growing need to offer persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) possibilities for self-management and to integrate multidisciplinary health data. In 2009-2014 we developed a patient-reported outcome based, interactive, web-based program (MSmonitor) for (self-)monitoring, self-management and integrated, multidisciplinary care in MS. METHODS: The notions underlying the MSmonitor concept and the program's elements are described. We analyze MSmonitor's role in the self-management of fatigue by retrospective comparison of fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) before and after usage of specific elements of MSmonitor, and by a correlative analysis between frequency of usage and fatigue change. RESULTS: After a step-wise development the program comprises six validated questionnaires: Multiple Sclerosis Impact Profile, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale-5 items (MFIS-5), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 items, and the 8-item Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (LMSQoL) questionnaires; two inventories: Medication and Adherence Inventory, Miction Inventory; two diaries: Activities Diary, Miction Diary; and two functionalities: e-consult and personal e-logbook. The program is now used in 17 hospitals by 581 PwMS and their neurologists, MS nurses, physical therapists, rehabilitative doctors, continence nurses, and family doctors. Those PwMS (N=105) who used the LMSQoL and MFIS-5 questionnaires at least twice in a period of up to 6 months, showed improved HRQoL (P<0.026). In the subgroup (N=56) who had also used the Activities Diary twice or more, the frequency of diary usage correlated modestly with the degree of fatigue improvement (r=0.292; P=0.028). CONCLUSION: MSmonitor is an interactive web-based program for self-management and integrated care in PwMS. Pilot data suggest that the repeated use of the short MFIS-5 and LMSQoL questionnaires is associated with an increase in HRQoL, and that a repeated use of the Activities Diary might contribute to the self-management of fatigue.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most common symptom in multiple sclerosis. Evidence-based treatment options are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility and potential effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in severely fatigued multiple sclerosis patients. METHODS: Non-randomized pilot study with a wai-ting list control period including 59 multiple sclerosis patients with severe fatigue. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength-20. Secondary measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Life Satisfaction Questionnaire, subscale sleep of the Symptom Checklist-90, Cognitive Failure Questionnaire, Fatigue Catastrophizing Scale, Coping Inventory of Stressful Situations, and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form. Measurements were taken before treatment (double baseline), after treatment, and at follow-up (3 months). RESULTS: Adherence rate was 71%. Eight out of 10 participants who completed the intervention were satisfied with the intervention. Significant time effects were found for 7 out of 11 outcome measures (p?=?0.006 to <?0.001). The effect size was moderate for all outcome measures that were significant post-treatment and/or at follow-up (?Ã‚Â²?=?0.10-0.17). Improvements were maintained at follow-up. Of the completers, 46% showed a clinically relevant change regarding fatigue. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is feasible in severely fatigued multiple sclerosis patients and has positive results in the reduction of severe fatigue and several psychological factors.",

"Title": "Developing a wellness program for people with multiple sclerosis: description and initial results",
"Abstract": "Because multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multidimensional chronic disease, effective management of the illness requires a multidimensional approach. We describe a wellness program that was designed to facilitate positive health choices throughout the course of MS and present initial data analyses. We hypothesized that over the course of the program, participants would demonstrate improvement in the domains assessed. The wellness program included educational sessions in physical, mental, social, intellectual, and spiritual domains specifically targeting improved self-efficacy, physical functioning, coping skills, symptom management, and nutrition. An outcomes data collection software program was adapted to facilitate real-time patient self-report and clinician entry data collection for many domains throughout the wellness program. Initial assessment of serial measures (intake to discharge) from 65 people with MS showed improvement in several domains, including functional status (P < .05), fatigue (P < .05), fear-avoidance beliefs regarding physical activities (P < .05), depression (P < .05), somatization (P < .05), and pain (P < .05). In addition, using a model of risk for interpersonal distress, patients whose risk of elevated depression and anxiety decreased over the course of the program reported greater gains in functional status (P < .05). The results suggest possible future treatment strategies and indicate strengths and weaknesses of the wellness program, which are being used to improve the program.",

"Title": "Evaluating the effect of enhanced physical activity and energy management on fatigue in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis: The MS TeleCoach study",
"Abstract": "Background: There is a great potential for telehealth, in which telemonitoring of a clinical parameter is combined with remote follow-up of a therapeutic intervention, in multiple sclerosis (MS) care. Fatigue in the context of MS is a complex symptom that affects 75-95% of all patients, of which 50-60 % classify fatigue as interfering most seriously with the activities of daily life. Aim: This pilot telehealth study evaluated whether telecoaching with a focus on energy management and enhancement of physical activity was able to improve fatigue in MS patients with moderate to severe fatigue during a 12 week-period. Methodology: 70 MS patients with moderate to severe fatigue were evaluated over 12 weeks in their home setting, with 4 assessments. Inclusion criteria were: having relapsing remitting MS, an EDSS of 4 or lower, treatment with glatiramer acetate for at least 6 weeks and a score of 53 or higher on the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions (FSMC). Patients with age 60 or above, with MDD, with severe cognitive impairment, injuries and pregnant patients were excluded. In a 2 week run-in period, daily activity was measured using the mobile MS TeleCoach handhold device. During the 12 week follow- up phase, fatigue was measured 3 times a day using the VAS impact on fatigue question and physical activity was continuously monitored via an integrated accelerometer in the MS TeleCoach. Patients receive coaching advice thrice weekly to enhance their physical activity (gradually increasing by 5 % versus baseline, every 3 weeks) compared to their baseline physical activity. Clinical status of the patient and 5 outcome measures (FSMC, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Short Form-36, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale and Illness Perception Scale) were assessed at all visits. Results: The mean difference in total FSMC score between end and start of the study was -6.37 (p=0.000056). The mean difference in the cognitive subscale of the FSMC score between end and start of the study was -2.9 (p=0.0011) and the mean difference in the motor subscale of the FSMC score between end and start of the study was -3.46 (p=0.00074). For the cognitive subscore, the mean FSMC score changed from severe to moderate fatigue classification. Further analysis differentiates between responders and non-responders to this telemedicine approach. Conclusion: A telehealth intervention using the MS TeleCoach device significantly decreased fatigue in Ms patients assessed with the FSMC.",

"Title": "Occupational therapy's role in improving well-being: A lifestyle redesign technique for optimal living with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects an individual's ability to perform desired daily activities due to functional difficulties. Occupational therapy (OT) helps people to participate in these activities of daily life to improve health and independence across the lifespan. Occupational therapists practicing Lifestyle Redesign help patients acquire health-promoting habits and routines to improve overall function, health, and quality of life. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a student-assisted OT lifestyle intervention that aims to improve function, healthy habits and routines, and quality of life in community members living with MS for quality improvement purposes. Methods: The Optimal Living with MS program is a 12-week course in which OT students deliver group and individual lifestyle interventions once per week for participants living with MS. The National MS Society recruits the participants, who also receive physical therapy (PT) for the duration of the program. Various lifestyle and functional areas are addressed through education and hands-on activities. Outcome measures utilized pre- and postprogram were the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Paired-samples t-tests were used to determine significant changes pre- and post-program. Results: COPM Performance score mean increased by 1.77 points (p<.0001, df=94), and COPM Satisfaction score increased by 2.71 points (p<.0001, df=94). On average, participants improved their perceived participation in self-identified areas of functional and lifestyle difficulty, and overall satisfaction with these areas increased. MFIS Physical Subscale mean decreased by 4.07 points (p<.0001, df=41), Cognitive Subscale mean decreased by 4.26 points (p=.0002, df=41), and Psychosocial Subscale mean decreased by 0.94 points (p=.0057, df=41). Total MFIS Score revealed a mean decrease of 9.24 points (p<.0001, df=41). On average, participants felt the impact of fatigue on various areas of functioning was lessened by the end of the program. Conclusion: This quality improvement study adds to a growing body of evidence that suggests lifestyle OT interventions can make a significant difference in function, health, and quality of life for people living with MS. More controlled research is needed to further investigate the effects of lifestyle OT without confounding factors (e.g., physical therapy) in MS care.",

"Title": "Cognitive training in MS: Effects and relation to brain atrophy",
"Abstract": "Purpose: Cognitive disorders are common in MS patients without any generally recommended treatment. Recent brain imaging studies show considerable neuroplasticity for cognitive tasks in MS patients, but also brain atrophy already early in the disease progression. We explored the benefits of a home-based cognitive training program for memory and working memory functions in relapsing-remitting MS patients controlling for whole brain and central brain atrophy as covariates. Methods: Using a single-blinded controlled Article Citation, 42 patients were randomised into a treatment group and a control group. Home based computer training focusing on memory and working memory was started at least 4 weeks after the discontinuation of methylprednisolone treatment and lasted for 6 weeks. Two weeks later the patients were re-investigated for their clinical and cognitive performance. We assessed also quality of life (QoL), depression and fatigue using self-rating scales. Results: Training had no effect on the neurological status and on QoL or fatigue. However, the treatment group showed better verbal learning, longdelay verbal memory performance, and working memory performance. The impact of treatment on long-delay verbal memory performance was independent from the extent of brain atrophy, whereas for the other findings brain atrophy played a significant role. Conclusions: An intensive home-based cognitive training program is suitable to improve the cognitive performance of MS patients. The impact of brain atrophy on rehabilitation outcome may differ for cognitive functions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study evaluated the effects of an energy conservation course on fatigue impact for persons with multiple sclerosis whose symptoms cause moderate to severe disability. METHODS: Thirty-seven persons with progressive multiple sclerosis participated in an 8-week experimental energy conservation course treatment and an 8-week control period of traditional treatment using a crossover design. The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) was used to assess fatigue impact before and after the experimental and control periods, and 8 weeks post-energy conservation course. RESULTS: After participation in the energy conservation course, the average FIS total score and physical, cognitive, and psychosocial subscale scores decreased significantly, whereas the total and subscale scores did not change significantly during the control period. Additionally, decreased fatigue impact was maintained 8 weeks after course completion for evaluated participants. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that this energy conservation course can be a beneficial intervention for persons with progressive multiple sclerosis.",

The biopsychosocial model of disease takes into account the multifaceted nature of chronic illness and is commonly applied to MS. The present investigation examined the effectiveness of a 10-week psychoeducational MS wellness program that was developed on the basis of the biopsychosocial model and a wellness approach to treatment. METHODS: The program consisted of 90-minute, weekly psychoeducational wellness group sessions aimed at improving quality of life by increasing awareness of the various social, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual factors that can affect the overall well-being of people living with MS. Fifty-four individuals with MS participated in the study (43 individuals who completed the wellness intervention and 11 individuals with MS who did not participate; \"controls\"). All participants completed a series of self-report questionnaires at baseline and at the 10-week follow-up, assessing depression, anxiety, perceived stress, cognitive complaints, pain, social support, and fatigue. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis revealed improvements in depression, anxiety, overall mental health, perceived stress, and pain in the treatment group compared with the control group. No significant differences were observed between the groups on measures assessing social support, cognitive complaints, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a psychoeducational wellness program is effective in improving the overall quality of life and well-being of individuals with MS.",

"Title": "Evaluating the effects of amantadine, modafinil, fatigue management programme and acetyl L carnitine on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Fatigue occurs in more than 60% of MS patients and nearly half of the patients describe it as the most disabling symptom of the disease. It has a major impact on quality of life on MS patients. Current treatment options for MS fatigue include amantadine, modafinil and acetyl L carnitine (ALCAR) and fatigue management program (FMP). The aim of our study was to compare efficacy of amantadine, modafinil, ALCAR and FMP with placebo in patients with MS. Methods: Patients with MS and a disability level = 6,5 on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and fatigue were included in the study. Patients were assigned to a one month treatment with either amantadine 200 mg, ALCAR 2g, modafinil 200 mg, FMP or placebo. Efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by using the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS). Results: Seventy five patients were included in the study (53 females). The mean age of patents was 38,3Ã‚Â±6,2 years and the mean disease duration was 6,6Ã‚Â±1,2 years. Contrast analysis showed significantly lower mean MFIS score after one month in patients on amantadine compared to placebo (mean difference = 17.3, p = 0.001) and FMP (mean difference = 24, p = 0,0001). There was also a trend of a lower MFIS score in ALCAR group in comparison to placebo (mean difference = 12.4, p = 0.05,). Comparison of amantadine and FMP group showed no significant difference in mean MFIS score (p = 0.67). Conclusion: The results of our study demonstrated that amantadine, FMP and partially ALCAR improved symptom of fatigue as evaluated by MFIS. On the other hand modafinil was not shown to be effective. MS related fatigue should be evaluated routinely and should be treated.",

"Title": "Specific versus aspecific intensive cognitive training in MS: Preliminary results of the SMICT study. (#88)",
"Abstract": "Objective: Cognitive interventions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are considered useful in ameliorating patients' neuropsychological deficits and quality of life (QoL); specific intensive training of attention and speed in information processing was reported to significantly and persistently improve treated functions in a controlled double blind study. The aim of the Italian SMICT study (Sclerosi Multipla intensive cognitive training) is to compare the efficacy of the specific cognitive training with a specific counseling. Methods: Patients were included if affected by relapsing remitting MS and treated with interferon ÃƒÅ¸ 1A 44 mcg 3/w no longer than 6 months, with a pathological score (< 1.5 SD) in at least one of the Rao Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB) test, Controlled Oral Word Associations (COWA) and Stroop test. They were randomized to have either specific computerized training of attention/ information processing or executive or memory impaired functions or a specific counseling lasting 4 months (2 hours per week). Neuropsychological evaluation as well as fatigue, QoL and depression functional scales are repeated at one and two year follow ups. The study (approved by the local ethical organism) originally involved 14 centers, among whom only 10 were able to provide inclusions. Results: Of 44 included patients preliminary results regarding 11 patients' one year follow up are presented. Five and six patients were respectively assigned to a specific (A) and specific (S) training (mean age 40 and 46 years, mean relapse number in the previous year 0.2 and 1.3, mean disability 1.9 and 2.6 at the Expanded Disability Status Scale). The impaired cognitive function in the A patients was memory in 3 and attention in 2 cases; in the S patients attention and executive functions in 5 and memory in 1 cases. At one year follow up mean changes (one year-baseline mean scores) in neuropsychological tests show an improvement in both groups in the majority of tests, although COWA, attention and verbal memory tests of the BRB, Stroop test, QoL and depression scales changes resulted to be higher in the A group, whereas Symbol Digit Modality Test and spatial memory test of the BRB higher in the S group. Conclusion: Results show the efficacy of both treatments at one year follow up and possibly suggest the advantage of the a specific counseling on several cognitive domains as well as on depression and QoL.",

"Title": "Efficacy of a neuropsychological training programme for patients with multiple sclerosis -- a randomised controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: One aim of this project was to investigate the efficacy of a specific training programme for MS patients which also contained compensation strategies and relaxation exercises relevant to everyday life. The other aim was to check the programme's relevance to everyday life. METHOD: 19 patients, randomised into two groups, took part in the study. The participants in the treated group completed a specific neurological training programme which began immediately after the basic testing (visit 1) and lasted 4 weeks, with a total of 12 sessions. The monitoring test was done immediately after the training programme (at visit 2) and the follow-up was 3 months later (visit 3). Both study groups were fully comparable as regards clinical and socio-demographic data and baseline intelligence level. RESULTS: The results of the cognitive training programme were especially evident in the significant improvements in executive functions (CKV) and spatial-constructional abilities (HAWIE-R). Comparison between the treated and the control group showed no significant difference in the fatigue values (MFIS). However, when the treated group was examined over the three times of measurements, the symptoms of fatigue had diminished significantly. Regarding memory, comparison of the groups showed no changes; within the treated group; however, the verbal (VLT) and nonverbal learning and memory (NVLT) improved significantly. The results for sustained attention improved in both groups over time. It must be assumed that a learning effect had occurred here. The depression values (BDI) also improved in both study groups. The follow-up questionnaire showed that 60% (6) attributed an average to above-average benefit to the training. CONCLUSION: To summarise, it is apparent that MS patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment are able to profit from even a fairly brief neuropsychological training programme and to integrate much of it into their everyday lives. In view of this, it would seem appropriate to offer such a programme as standard, associated with medication.",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial to determine effect of strategies on cognitive performance and fatigue in multiple sclerosis: Does pacing help?",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is a common disabling symptom in MS, but management strategies have not been systematically evaluated. Methods: 29 MS patients (17 SP, 12 PP; mean disease duration 16.1y; 17 female; mean age 54.1 years; mean pre-morbid IQ 109.8) and 31 matched healthy control participants (16 female; mean age 52.4 years; mean pre-morbid IQ 110.1) were recruited. MS and healthy participants were separately randomised to one of three conditions: continuous verbal list learning, alternating verbal list and spatial memory tasks, or verbal list learning alternating with rest (Ã¢â‚¬Å“pacingÃ¢â‚¬Â). They were assessed on parallel forms of the BRB-N before and after the intervention, from which a cognitive impairment index was calculated. They completed depression (CES-D) and fatigue (FSS) questionnaires at the start and four VAS fatigue scales spaced through the ninety minute schedule. Results: The MS group reported more depression (CES-D) and fatigue (FSS) than the healthy group. A 2x3x2 (group x condition x cognition time 1, time 2) mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of group (F(1,54) = 16.07,p < .001), no main effect of condition and a main effect of time of cognitive performance (F(1,54) = 18.56,p < .001). The MS group's cognitive performance was worse than the healthy group's. Both groups' cognitive performance was worse after the mental effort required by the intervention. There were no significant interactions. Covarying depression scores removed the main group effect on cognitive performance. A 2x3x4 (group x condition x self-reported fatigue at 4 time points) mixed ANOVA revealed no significant main effect of group and no main effect of condition; however there was a main effect of time on self-reported fatigue (F(1,75) = 48.33,p < .001). There were no significant interactions. There was no difference between the MS and healthy groups' report of fatigue on VAS. Both groups reported increased fatigue over time as they completed the schedule. Conclusions: Effortful mental tasks increased self-reported fatigue and reduced cognitive performance equally in both MS and healthy participants. The MS participants' cognitive performance was poorer than the healthy participants' overall, but this could be explained by depression. Two of three experimental conditions mimicked fatigue management strategies taught on eclectic self-management courses, but had no differential effect on cognitive performance decrement, or self-reported fatigue, in this study.",

"Title": "A pilot randomized controlled trial of a tailored cognitive behavioural therapy based intervention for depressive symptoms in those newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of an 8-week individual tailored cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for the treatment of depressive symptoms in those newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: The current study presents a pilot, parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an allocation ratio of 1:1 conducted in a large research and teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. 30 individuals with a mean age of 36.93 years (SD=9.63) who were newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) (X=24.87 months, SD=15.61) were randomized to the CBT intervention (n=15) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n=15). The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Secondary outcomes were level of anxiety, fatigue and pain impact, sleep quality, coping, acceptance of MS illness, MS related quality of life, social support, and resilience. Tertiary outcomes were acceptability and adherence to the intervention. RESULTS: Large between group treatment effects were found for level of depressive symptoms at post and at 20 weeks follow-up (d=1.66-1.34). There were also small to large group treatment effects for level of anxiety, fatigue and pain impact, sleep quality, MS related quality of life, resilience, and social support at post and at 20 weeks follow-up (d=0.17-1.63). There were no drop-outs and participants completed all treatment modules. All participants reported the treatment as 'very useful', and most (73.4%) reported that the intervention had addressed their problems 'completely'. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the tailored early intervention is appropriate and clinically effective for the treatment of depressive symptoms in those newly diagnosed with MS. A larger RCT comparing the CBT intervention with an active comparative treatment with longer term follow-up and cost effectiveness analyses is warranted. The pilot trial has been retrospectively registered on 28/04/2016 with the ISRCTN registry (trial ID ISRCTN10423371).",

"Title": "Integrative group-based cognitive rehabilitation efficacy in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Cognitive impairment is a common consequence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). There is some evidence for the efficacy of individual cognitive rehabilitation, but very few studies have attempted to address simultaneously the wide range of cognitive domains affected in a group format. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the efficacy of an integrative group-based cognitive rehabilitation program (REHACOP) on improving cognitive functioning in MS. Methods: Thirty-two MS participants were randomly assigned to the experimental (n=16) or control (n=16) group. The experimental group received cognitive rehabilitation for three months (three one-hour sessions per week) focused on attention (sustained, selective, alternating and divided attention), learning and memory (verbal and visual memory, as well as working memory), executive functioning (objectives planning and attainment, verbal reasoning, categorisation and conceptualisation), language (verbal fluency, syntax, grammar, vocabulary and comprehension) and social cognition (social reasoning, theory of mind and moral dilemmas). Participants underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment at baseline and follow-up, which included measures of attention (The Brief test of attention), working memory (Backward Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III), processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the three and six letter version of the Salthouse Perceptual Comparison Test and the Trail Making Test A), verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised), verbal fluency (Calibrated Ideational Fluency Assessment) and executive functioning (Stroop Color-Word Test). Significant differences between groups were found in neurologic impairment and mental fatigue scores, so these variables were included as covariates in repeated measures MANCOVA. Results: Group x time interactions showed that participants completing the REHACOP exhibited significant improvements when compared to the control group on working memory (p=0.004, np2=0.26), processing speed (p=0.030, np2=0.16), verbal memory (p=0.035, np2=0.15) and executive functioning (p=0.035, np2=0.15). Conclusion: Participants receiving REHACOP showed large improvements in several cognitive domains. These results suggest that cognitive rehabilitation using an integrative approach and administered in a group format can significantly improve cognitive functioning in persons with MS.",

"Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based cognitive rehabilitation (CR) program based on the video game Dr Kawashima's Brain Training (DKBT; Nintendo, Japan), in improving attention, processing speed, and working memory of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: This was a randomized, wait-list control study. Patients with MS and failure in at least one between Stroop Test (ST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were submitted to an 8-week home-based CR program playing DKBT. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after DKBT by the aforementioned tests, by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and by the MS Quality of Life-54 questionnaire (MSQoL-54). Results: Fifty-two 52 patients were screened for eligibility; 35 (mean [standard deviation] age of 43.9 [8.4] years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 2.0 (range = 2.0-6.0) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 18) or wait-list control group (n = 17). ANCOVA analysis showed a significant effect of DKBT on ST (F = 5.027; P = .034; F2 = 0.210), SDMT (F = 4.240; P = .049; F2 = 0.177), and on some subscales of MSQoL-54. The PASAT and cognitive subscale of MFIS also showed an improvement, but this was just not significant (F = 4.104, P = .054, F2 = 0.171, and F = 4.226, P = .054, F2 = 0.237, respectively). Conclusion: We suggest that a home-based DKBT program may improve cognitive functions, some aspects of QoL, and cognitive fatigue in patients with MS.

"Abstract": "Background: Forty to sixty percent of MS patients suffer from cognitive impairments. Cognitive deficits are a great burden for patients affected. In particular they may lead to a reduced quality of life, loss of work and problems with the social environment. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate a specific neuropsychological rehabilitation program for MS patients according to the ICF to be able to meet more properly individual requirements on the therapy level of function as well as of activities and participation. Methods: Forty patients with MS were randomised in an intervention (IG)-and a control group (CG). The outcome measure of the IG, who started an intensive computer based home training of attention and attended psychological counselling was compared to the untrained CG. Results: In specific domains of attention (simple and cued alertness and divided attention) significant group differences between CG and IG could be found. The IG reported an improvement of mental fatigue and retardation. Conclusions: These findings support the idea that a neuropsychological rehabilitation program, which based on the model of ICF, could improve cognitive impairment and could also have a positive influence of activities and participation.

"Title": "Efficacy of a short cognitive training program in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Cognitive impairment is a common feature in multiple sclerosis (MS) and may have a substantial impact on quality of life. Evidence about the effectiveness of neuropsychological rehabilitation is still limited, but current data suggest that computer-assisted cognitive training improves cognitive performance. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combined computer-assisted training supported by home-based neuropsychological training to improve attention, processing speed, memory and executive functions during 3 consecutive months. Methods: In this randomized controlled study blinded for the evaluators, 62 MS patients with clinically stable disease and mild-to-moderate levels of cognitive impairment were randomized to receive a computer-assisted neuropsychological training program (n=30) or no intervention (control group [CG]; n=32). The cognitive assessment included the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test. Other secondary measures included subjective cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression, fatigue and quality of life measures. Results: The treatment group (TG) showed significant improvements in measures of verbal memory, working memory and phonetic fluency after intervention, and repeated measures analysis of covariance revealed a positive effect in most of the functions. The control group (CG) did not show changes. The TG showed a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and significant improvement in quality of life. There were no improvements in fatigue levels and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Cognitive intervention with a computer-assisted training supported by home training between face-to-face sessions is a useful tool to treat patients with MS and improve functions such as verbal memory, working memory and phonetic fluency.",

"Title": "Effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There has long been a belief that depression contributes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) although supporting data are minimal at best. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of fatigue include recommendations for the treatment of depression in the absence of clear empirical support. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in MS. METHODS: Sixty patients with a relapsing form of MS and moderate to severe depression were randomly assigned to one of three validated 16-week treatments for depression: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group psychotherapy, or sertraline. Assessments at baseline and treatment cessation included the primary outcome measure, fatigue assessment instrument (FAI), and Beck depression inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The total FAI and the global fatigue severity subscale were significantly reduced over the course of treatment (p values <.02). Other subscales did not change significantly. Secondary analyses showed change in global fatigue severity was associated with change in BDI (p =.03) but change in total FAI was only marginally related to change in BDI (p =.05). These relationships were due entirely to change in mood (p values <.02) and not to change in cognitive or vegetative symptoms (p values >.17). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that treatment for depression is associated with reductions in the severity of fatigue symptoms, and that this relationship is due primarily to treatment related changes in mood.",

"Title": "A randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy for multiple sclerosis fatigue",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) fatigue. METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used where 72 patients with MS fatigue were randomly assigned to eight weekly sessions of CBT or relaxation training (RT). RT was designed to control for therapist time and attention. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. The primary outcome was the Fatigue Scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of stress, mood, and fatigue-related impairment. RESULTS: Analysis was by intention-to-treat. A group by time interaction showed that the CBT group reported significantly greater reductions in fatigue across the 8 months compared with the RT group (p < .02). Calculated effect sizes for fatigue from baseline to the end of treatment were 3.03 [95% confidence interval, 2.22-3.68] for the CBT group and 1.83 [95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.34] for the RT group. Results also indicted that both groups showed clinically significant decreases in fatigue defined as fatigue levels equivalent or less than those reported by a non-fatigued healthy comparison group. There were no significant interactions between group and any of the secondary outcome variables, with both groups showing improvements over time on all measures. INTERPRETATION: Both CBT and RT appear to be clinically effective treatments for fatigue in MS patients, although the effects for CBT are greater than those for RT. Even 6 months after treatment, both treatment groups reported levels of fatigue equivalent to those of the healthy comparison group.",

"Title": "Effectiveness of an internet-based treatment programme for depression in multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Depression is one of the most frequent comorbidities in multiple sclerosis (MS) with a lifetime risk for major depressive disorder of up to 50%. Depression in MS has a significant impact on patients' social function, quality of life, treatment adherence, and risk of suicide, but remains widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Novel approaches to treat depression are therefore needed. Here, we investigated the potential of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based internet program (Deprexis) to reduce depressive symptoms in MS. Ninety MS patients (20 male, 70 female, aged 18-65 years) were recruited. Main inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MS and a self-reported need for depression therapy. All subjects provided informed consent prior to enrollment. Patients were randomized to Deprexis or a waitlist control group. Deprexis is a 9-week online tool that has successfully been used to treat depression in patients without neurological disorders. It consists of 12 modules covering CBT-components such as behavioral activation, cognitive modification, problem solving, and emotion-focused interventions. Deprexis is fully automated and does not involve live interaction with a therapist but adapts the modules based on participants' responses. The primary endpoint of this study was depressive symptomatology as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcomes included quality of life and fatigue. At baseline, mean BDI score was 19. Seventy patients completed the trial. The drop-out rate was 22% but did not differ between the groups. After the intervention, BDI scores decreased significantly in the Deprexis group and slightly increased in the control group, yielding a significant treatment effect with a moderate- to-large effect size (p = .01, d = .74). In addition, significant treatment effects were seen in subdomains of quality of life and fatigue.",

"Title": "Cognitive behavioral therapy positively affects fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis: Results of a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) and often restricts societal participation. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may alleviate MS-related fatigue, but evidence in literature is inconclusive. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of CBT to improve MS-related fatigue and participation. Methods: In a multi-center, assessor-masked, randomized controlled trial, participants with severe MS-related fatigue were assigned to CBT or control treatment. CBT consisted of 12 individual sessions with a psychologist trained in CBT, the control treatment consisted of three consultations with a MS nurse, both delivered over 16 weeks. Assessments were at baseline, 8, 16 (i.e. post-intervention), 26, and 52 weeks post-baseline. Primary outcomes were the Checklist Individual Strength-fatigue subscale (CIS20r fatigue) and the Impact on Participation and Autonomy questionnaire (IPA). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle, using mixed-model analysis. Results: Between 2011 and 2014, 91 patients were randomized (CBT: n = 44; control: n = 47). Between-group analysis showed a positive post-intervention effect for CBT on CIS20r fatigue (T16: -6.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) = -10.7; -2.7) points) that diminished during follow-up (T52: 0.5 (95% CI = -3.6; 4.4)). No clinically relevant effects were found on societal participation. Conclusion: Severe MS-related fatigue can be reduced effectively with CBT in the short term. More research is needed on how to maintain this effect over the long term.",

"Title": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation has beneficial effects on perceived cognitive deficits in multiple sclerosis during nine-month follow-up",
"Abstract": "Background: Systematic reviews have indicated a low level of evidence for the positive effects of neuropsychological and cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis (MS). How permanent the positive effects are, is unknown. Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether short-term neuropsychological rehabilitation has long-term beneficial effects in a nine-month follow-up. Methods: 102 relapsing-remitting MS patients with subjective and objective attentional deficits were randomized into intervention and control groups. Altogether 78 out of 102 patients (76%) completed the longitudinal follow-up (intervention group 83%, control group 67%). Intervention group received strategy-oriented neuropsychological rehabilitation conducted once a week in 60-minute sessions during thirteen consecutive weeks. The control group received no intervention. Cognitive deficits, mood, fatigue, impact of disease, and quality of life were evaluated with self-reports at baseline, six months, and one year from baseline. Results: The positive effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation on perceived cognitive deficits were maintained for nine-months. Among a subgroup of patients with moderate to severe attentional deficits, positive rehabilitation outcome was even more evident. Conclusion: The beneficial effects of strategy-oriented neuropsychological rehabilitation on perceived cognitive deficits in MS may be maintained for at least one year after the beginning of the intervention.

"Title": "Reduction in disability in a randomized controlled trial of telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the efficacy of telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (T-CBT) and telephone-administered supportive emotion-focused therapy (T-SEFT) in reducing disability among disabled patients with multiple sclerosis and depression. Telephone administration of therapy allowed care to be delivered to a more disabled population. This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial; the primary outcome results for depression are reported in D. C. Mohr, S. L. Hart, L. Julian, C. Catledge, L. Honos-Webb, L. Vella, et al. (2005). DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial, comparing 16 weeks of T-CBT with T-SEFT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability was measured using Guy's Neurological Disability Scale; fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Impact Scale; depression was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. RESULTS: Patients in both treatments showed significant improvements in disability and fatigue. These improvements were related to reductions in depression. T-CBT produced significantly greater decreases in disability and fatigue, compared with T-SEFT, even after controlling for depression. The greater benefit of T-CBT on disability was mediated by physical fatigue. CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that significant reductions in disability can be achieved by reducing depression in patients with multiple sclerosis. There was also evidence that further reductions could be achieved through CBT-specific interventions that include a focus on symptoms such as fatigue management.

"Title": "Specific versus aspecific intensive cognitive training in MS: Preliminary results of the SMICT study. (#88)",
"Abstract": "Objective: Cognitive interventions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are considered useful in ameliorating patients' neuropsychological deficits and quality of life (QoL); specific intensive training of attention and speed in information processing was reported to significantly and persistently improve treated functions in a controlled double blind study. The aim of the Italian SMICT study (Sclerosi Multipla intensive cognitive training) is to compare the efficacy of the specific cognitive training with a specific counseling. Methods: Patients were included if affected by relapsing remitting MS and treated with interferon ÃƒÅ¸ 1A 44 mcg 3/w no longer than 6 months, with a pathological score (< 1.5 SD) in at least one of the Rao Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB) test, Controlled Oral Word Associations (COWA) and Stroop test. They were randomized to have either specific computerized training of attention/ information processing or executive or memory impaired functions or a specific counseling lasting 4 months (2 hours per week). Neuropsychological evaluation as well as fatigue, QoL and depression functional scales are repeated at one and two year follow ups. The study (approved by the local ethical organism) originally involved 14 centers, among whom only 10 were able to provide inclusions. Results: Of 44 included patients preliminary results regarding 11 patients' one year follow up are presented. Five and six patients were respectively assigned to a specific (A) and specific (S) training (mean age 40 and 46 years, mean relapse number in the previous year 0.2 and 1.3, mean disability 1.9 and 2.6 at the Expanded Disability Status Scale). The impaired cognitive function in the A patients was memory in 3 and attention in 2 cases; in the S patients attention and executive functions in 5 and memory in 1 cases. At one year follow up mean changes (one year-baseline mean scores) in neuropsychological tests show an improvement in both groups in the majority of tests, although COWA, attention and verbal memory tests of the BRB, Stroop test, QoL and depression scales changes resulted to be higher in the A group, whereas Symbol Digit Modality Test and spatial memory test of the BRB higher in the S group. Conclusion: Results show the efficacy of both treatments at one year follow up and possibly suggest the advantage of the a specific counseling on several cognitive domains as well as on depression and QoL.",

"Title": "Energy conservation for fatigue management in multiple sclerosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the feasibility of an energy conservation programme to manage fatigue in multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: A pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community setting. SUBJECTS: People with multiple sclerosis reporting fatigue. INTERVENTIONS: An energy conservation programme was compared to a peer support group. Both interventions were delivered in group format with 2-hour sessions once a week for five weeks. Patients' views about the interventions were sought in discussion groups one week post intervention. MAIN MEASURES: The primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment and adherence. Other outcome measures were the Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, MS-Impact Scale-29, MS Self-efficacy Scale, Beck's Depression Scale-Fast Screen and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Outcomes were administered at baseline, post intervention, 6-week and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Almost 30% of the people approached to take part in the study did not commit to participation because of transport/time issues. Twenty-three patients took part in the study. Three patients dropped out, one reporting adverse effects. A power calculation indicated that a sample of 56 (28 per group) would be required for a main randomized controlled trial. Patients valued peer support and those in the energy conservation group described the programme as useful, but reported difficulties completing some practice activities. CONCLUSION: An energy conservation programme in the community is feasible and welcomed by people with multiple sclerosis. However, future research needs to consider longer follow-ups and practical issues to improve recruitment rate by accommodating to patients' needs.",

"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is a common disabling symptom in MS, but management strategies have not been systematically evaluated. Methods: 29 MS patients (17 SP, 12 PP; mean disease duration 16.1y; 17 female; mean age 54.1 years; mean pre-morbid IQ 109.8) and 31 matched healthy control participants (16 female; mean age 52.4 years; mean pre-morbid IQ 110.1) were recruited. MS and healthy participants were separately randomised to one of three conditions: continuous verbal list learning, alternating verbal list and spatial memory tasks, or verbal list learning alternating with rest (Ã¢â‚¬Å“pacingÃ¢â‚¬Â). They were assessed on parallel forms of the BRB-N before and after the intervention, from which a cognitive impairment index was calculated. They completed depression (CES-D) and fatigue (FSS) questionnaires at the start and four VAS fatigue scales spaced through the ninety minute schedule. Results: The MS group reported more depression (CES-D) and fatigue (FSS) than the healthy group. A 2x3x2 (group x condition x cognition time 1, time 2) mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of group (F(1,54) = 16.07,p < .001), no main effect of condition and a main effect of time of cognitive performance (F(1,54) = 18.56,p < .001). The MS group's cognitive performance was worse than the healthy group's. Both groups' cognitive performance was worse after the mental effort required by the intervention. There were no significant interactions. Covarying depression scores removed the main group effect on cognitive performance. A 2x3x4 (group x condition x self-reported fatigue at 4 time points) mixed ANOVA revealed no significant main effect of group and no main effect of condition; however there was a main effect of time on self-reported fatigue (F(1,75) = 48.33,p < .001). There were no significant interactions. There was no difference between the MS and healthy groups' report of fatigue on VAS. Both groups reported increased fatigue over time as they completed the schedule. Conclusions: Effortful mental tasks increased self-reported fatigue and reduced cognitive performance equally in both MS and healthy participants. The MS participants' cognitive performance was poorer than the healthy participants' overall, but this could be explained by depression. Two of three experimental conditions mimicked fatigue management strategies taught on eclectic self-management courses, but had no differential effect on cognitive performance decrement, or self-reported fatigue, in this study.",

"Abstract": "Purpose to evaluate the effectiveness of an individual self-management occupational therapy intervention program (SMOoTh) versus relaxation on the performance of and satisfaction with relevant daily activities in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue. in a single-blind randomized-controlled trial, 31 patients with MS (SMOoTh: n=17, relaxation: n=14) were randomly allocated to three individual sessions focusing on pacing, prioritizing, ergonomics, and self-management (SMOoTh) or on stress management and relaxation (relaxation). Outcomes (blind assessor): Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (primary), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Checklist Individual Strength and Short-Form Health Measure. COPM improved in the SMOoTh and relaxation group after the intervention and 3 months later (COPM performance: F=13.1, P=0.001 and COPM satisfaction: F=10.4, P=0.001); nonsignificant group differences showed a trend in favor of SMOoTh. Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Checklist Individual Strength, and most of the Short-Form Health Measure subscales did not change. Clinically relevant changes in COPM performance scores were found in 71 and 27% of patients in the SMOoTh versus the relaxation group. Both interventions seem to be feasible approaches to improve performance of and satisfaction with relevant daily activities in people with MS, with a sustained effect after 3 months. Neither program altered change fatigue (impact) or quality of life. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial using an independent randomization system built into the website and intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Participants were recruited through the local Multiple Sclerosis Society and hospital neurological services in New Zealand. SUBJECTS: A total of 39 people (aged 31-63?years), experiencing multiple sclerosis fatigue, able to walk with and without walking aids, were randomized to MSInvigor8-Only (n = 20) or to MSInvigor8-Plus (n = 19). INTERVENTIONS: MSInvigor8 is an eight-session programme based on cognitive behaviour therapy principles including psycho-education, self-monitoring, and changing unhelpful activity and thought patterns. MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measures included fatigue severity (Chalder Fatigue Scale) and impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Assessments were performed at baseline and at 10?weeks. RESULTS: The MSInvigor8-Plus condition resulted in significantly greater reductions in fatigue severity (F [1,36] = 9.09, p < 0.01) and impact (F [1,36] = 6.03, p < 0.02) compared with the MSInvigor8-Only condition. Large between-group effect sizes for fatigue severity (d = 0.99) and fatigue impact (d = 0.81) were obtained. No significant differences were found between the groups on changes in anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: MSInvigor8 delivered with email-based support is a potentially promising, acceptable, and cost-effective approach to treating fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis in New Zealand.",

"Title": "Improving fatigue and depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis using telephone-administered physical activity counseling",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a physical activity intervention consisting of telephone counseling with home-based monitoring to improve fatigue and depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: Single-blind randomized controlled trial. Sixty-four individuals with MS received either telephone counseling (N = 31), or self-directed physical activity education (N = 33). The education condition (EC) consisted of advice to increase physical activity and a DVD with examples of in-home exercises for multiple physical ability levels. The telephone counseling condition (TC) included EC as well as mailed graphic feedback, 6 telephone counseling sessions using principles of motivational interviewing, and telehealth home monitoring to track progress on physical activity goals. Booster sessions were provided when participants indicated they did not meet their goals. Assessment was conducted at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: TC participants reported significantly reduced fatigue (d = -.70), reduced depression (d = -.72) and increased physical activity (d = .92) relative to EC participants. Of individuals receiving TC, 33.3% experienced clinically significant improvement in fatigue (vs. 18.2% in EC) and 53.3% experienced clinically significant improvement in depression (vs. 9.1% in EC). Improvements in physical activity mediated improvements in fatigue with a similar trend for depression. TC was highly feasible (participants completed 99.5% of schedule telephone sessions) and well tolerated (100% rated it highly successful). CONCLUSION: Telephone-based counseling with home monitoring is a promising modality to improve physical activity and treat fatigue and depression.",

"Title": "Effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There has long been a belief that depression contributes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) although supporting data are minimal at best. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of fatigue include recommendations for the treatment of depression in the absence of clear empirical support. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in MS. METHODS: Sixty patients with a relapsing form of MS and moderate to severe depression were randomly assigned to one of three validated 16-week treatments for depression: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group psychotherapy, or sertraline. Assessments at baseline and treatment cessation included the primary outcome measure, fatigue assessment instrument (FAI), and Beck depression inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The total FAI and the global fatigue severity subscale were significantly reduced over the course of treatment (p values <.02). Other subscales did not change significantly. Secondary analyses showed change in global fatigue severity was associated with change in BDI (p =.03) but change in total FAI was only marginally related to change in BDI (p =.05). These relationships were due entirely to change in mood (p values <.02) and not to change in cognitive or vegetative symptoms (p values >.17). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that treatment for depression is associated with reductions in the severity of fatigue symptoms, and that this relationship is due primarily to treatment related changes in mood.",

"Title": "A randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy for multiple sclerosis fatigue",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) fatigue. METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used where 72 patients with MS fatigue were randomly assigned to eight weekly sessions of CBT or relaxation training (RT). RT was designed to control for therapist time and attention. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. The primary outcome was the Fatigue Scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of stress, mood, and fatigue-related impairment. RESULTS: Analysis was by intention-to-treat. A group by time interaction showed that the CBT group reported significantly greater reductions in fatigue across the 8 months compared with the RT group (p < .02). Calculated effect sizes for fatigue from baseline to the end of treatment were 3.03 [95% confidence interval, 2.22-3.68] for the CBT group and 1.83 [95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.34] for the RT group. Results also indicted that both groups showed clinically significant decreases in fatigue defined as fatigue levels equivalent or less than those reported by a non-fatigued healthy comparison group. There were no significant interactions between group and any of the secondary outcome variables, with both groups showing improvements over time on all measures. INTERPRETATION: Both CBT and RT appear to be clinically effective treatments for fatigue in MS patients, although the effects for CBT are greater than those for RT. Even 6 months after treatment, both treatment groups reported levels of fatigue equivalent to those of the healthy comparison group.",

INTERVENTIONS: Eight-week individual telephone-delivered self-management intervention (T-SM) (n=75) versus an 8-week individual telephone-delivered MS education intervention (T-ED) (n=88). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion who achieved a >=50% decrease in 1 or more symptoms-fatigue impact, pain interference, and/or depression severity. Secondary outcomes included continuous measures of pain, fatigue impact, depression, self-efficacy, activation, health-related quality of life, resilience, and affect. RESULTS: For our primary outcome, 58% of those in the T-SM group and 46% of those in the T-ED group had a >=50% reduction in 1 or more symptoms; this difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, .77-2.93; P=.238). Participants in both groups significantly improved from baseline to posttreatment in primary and secondary outcome measures (P<.05). T-SM participants reported significantly higher treatment satisfaction and therapeutic alliance and greater improvements in activation, positive affect, and social roles. Improvements were generally maintained at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions resulted in short- and long-term, clinically meaningful benefits. The study demonstrated that the telephone is an effective method for engaging participants in care and extending the reach of rehabilitation for individuals with MS.

"Title": "A cluster randomised controlled trial on the efficacy of client-centred occupational therapy in multiple sclerosis: good process, poor outcome",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of client-centred occupational therapy (OT) according to a client-centred process framework, as compared to usual care OT, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: A multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with the institution (i.e. hospital or rehabilitation centre) as the unit of randomisation was performed. A total of 269 outpatients with MS, 13 hospitals and rehabilitation centres and 29 occupational therapists participated. Primary outcomes included measures of disability, participation and autonomy. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, generic health-related quality of life, quality and evaluation of therapy, therapy compliance and therapy frequency. Measurements were taken at baseline, four months and at eight months follow-up. RESULTS: Primary outcome measures did not show significant differences between the two interventions. Secondary outcomes revealed significant differences in favour of the usual care OT on fatigue (physical scale and total scale) and health-related quality of life (bodily pain and vitality) at four months. After eight months only significant differences on mental health were found. Process outcomes (i.e. the information scale of therapy quality and the client-centredness of the organisation) were in favour of the client-centred intervention. CONCLUSION: Because the client-centred intervention resulted in no effects on the primary outcomes and small but negative effects on the secondary functional outcomes, we should seriously reconsider the application of client-centred practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: An increasing number of interventions claim to incorporate client-centred practice. Client-centred practice is associated with improved satisfaction but the effects on functional health-related outcomes have not been fully evaluated. The findings of this study show that the process outcomes of therapy were in favour of the client-centred intervention, but no effects were found on the primary outcomes and negative effects on the secondary functional health outcomes. It is suggested that the implementation of client-centred practice should be adjusted in order to achieve optimal health outcomes.",

"Title": "Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of an Exercise-Based Patient Education Programme in People with Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study",
"Abstract": "Background. Although people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) benefit from physical exercise, they still show reduced physical activity and exercise behaviour. This study aimed to investigate short- and long-term effects of an exercise-based patient education programme (ePEP) that focuses on empowering pwMS to a sustainable and self-regulated exercise training management. Methods. Fourteen pwMS were randomly assigned to immediate experimental group (EG-I: n = 8) and waitlist-control group (EG-W: n = 6) and attended biweekly in a six-week ePEP. All participants were measured for walking ability, quality of life, fatigue, and self-efficacy towards physical exercise before and after the ePEP, after 12 weeks, and one year after baseline. Short-term effects were analysed in a randomised control trial and long-term effects of all ePEP participants (EG-I + EG-W = EG-all) in a quasi-experimental design. Results. Only functional gait significantly improved in EG-I compared to EG-W (p = 0.008, r = - 0.67). Moderate to large effects were found in EG-all for walking ability. Not significant, however, relevant changes were detected for quality of life and fatigue. Self-efficacy showed no changes. Conclusion. The ePEP seems to be a feasible option to empower pwMS to a self-regulated and sustainable exercise training management shown in long-term walking improvements.",

"Title": "Maximising abilities, negotiating and generating exercise options (manage) program: A pilot randomised controlled trial in persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Persons with Multiple sclerosis (MS) often require therapy on a long-term basis, to maintain or improve their MS symptoms. The role of self management is increasingly being accepted as an effective way to improve outcomes in people with chronic conditions such as MS. A model of care that included this within a group environment could be a more effective and economical management option than traditional individual based care. Purpose: To determine the safety and feasibility of a self management community program in persons with MS. Secondary aims were to describe trends associated with the program on mobility, balance, fatigue, pain, quality of life, and perception of benefits and barriers to exercise. Methods: Single site, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Twenty-three participants (43% male), mean age 48.6 (11.7) years with MS living in the community were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 11). The intervention group received twice weekly exercise and education for six weeks followed by assisted integration into a community exercise program. Outcome measures (adverse safety events, pain, fatigue, adherence, 10 metre walk test, 6-minute walk test, Functional Reach, Fatigue Severity Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale) were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks by a blinded assessor. Results: High adherence rates were achieved for attendance of the education (79%; 57 of 72 planned) and exercise (76%; 128 of 168 planned) sessions. No adverse safety events occurred. Significant differences were observed in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-Physical subscale (p = 0.016) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) fatigue (p = 0.017) between groups over time in favour of the intervention group. Within the intervention group significant improvements were seen from baseline to 6 weeks in the Functional Reach (p = 0.014), 6-minute walk test (p = 0.044), Fatigue Severity Scale (p = 0.034) and VAS pain (p = 0.034); and from baseline to 12 weeks in the Functional Reach (p = 0.023). There were no significant differences observed with the addition of the 24 week data. Conclusion(s): The MANAGE program, comprising of education, exercise and community integration in a group setting for persons with MS, appears safe and feasible. The initial findings of improvements in quality of life, pain, endurance, balance and fatigue levels in this small cohort are promising. Further research with a larger, adequately powered, RCT is needed to substantiate these findings. Future research considering the cost effectiveness of the MANAGE program in comparison with traditional individual therapy would also be beneficial. Implications: The use of this model of care for persons with MS could be an effective adjunct or potential alternative to current individual therapy approaches. The group format may result in greater efficiencies within service delivery. The self management approach is patient centred and goal focussed, which are critical components for long-term management of chronic diseases such as MS. This model may be of benefit to other chronic disease populations.",

"Title": "Energy conservation for fatigue management in multiple sclerosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the feasibility of an energy conservation programme to manage fatigue in multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: A pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community setting. SUBJECTS: People with multiple sclerosis reporting fatigue. INTERVENTIONS: An energy conservation programme was compared to a peer support group. Both interventions were delivered in group format with 2-hour sessions once a week for five weeks. Patients' views about the interventions were sought in discussion groups one week post intervention. MAIN MEASURES: The primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment and adherence. Other outcome measures were the Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, MS-Impact Scale-29, MS Self-efficacy Scale, Beck's Depression Scale-Fast Screen and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Outcomes were administered at baseline, post intervention, 6-week and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Almost 30% of the people approached to take part in the study did not commit to participation because of transport/time issues. Twenty-three patients took part in the study. Three patients dropped out, one reporting adverse effects. A power calculation indicated that a sample of 56 (28 per group) would be required for a main randomized controlled trial. Patients valued peer support and those in the energy conservation group described the programme as useful, but reported difficulties completing some practice activities. CONCLUSION: An energy conservation programme in the community is feasible and welcomed by people with multiple sclerosis. However, future research needs to consider longer follow-ups and practical issues to improve recruitment rate by accommodating to patients' needs.",

"Abstract": "Introduction: The chronic nature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), have can leave devastating effects on quality of life and fatigue. The present research aimed to study the effect of group Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and conscious yoga program on the quality of life and fatigue severity among patients with MS. Methods: This study was quasi-experimental with intervention and control groups. The statistical population included all members to MS Society of Tehran Province, 24 of whom diagnosed with MS were selected as the sample based on the inclusion criteria. The subjects were randomly assigned into the test group (12 patients) and the control group (12 patients). MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were used for data collection. Subjects in the test group underwent a MBSR and conscious yoga program in 8 two-hour sessions. The data were analyzed using the SPSS ver.13 software. Results: The study findings showed that there was a significant difference between subjects in the experimental and control groups in terms of mean score of some subscales of quality of life including physical health, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, energy, emotional well-being, health distress, health perception, and satisfaction with sexual function, overall quality of life, and fatigue severity. Conclusion: The results show that the program is effective in reduction of fatigue severity and improving some subscales of quality of life in MS patients. Hence, this supportive method can be used as an effective way for improving quality of life and relieving fatigue in MS patients.",

"Title": "Telehealth mindfulness meditation improves cognitive performance in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS)",
"Abstract": "Objective: To assess the feasibility and benefit of the remote delivery of mindfulness training to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Background: Mindfulness meditation is a stress reduction technique that has been shown to reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for those living with MS. However, the requirement to attend weekly group sessions can limit access to patients with mobility or transportation barrier. We sought to evaluate the feasibility and benefit by remotely-delivering access to mindfulness training to reach participants in their homes using a group teleconference platform. Methods: MS participants were 2:1 randomized to either active training (one hourly phone session per week) or a control condition of initial instruction only (with no further training) for six weeks. A battery of cognitive tests and self-reported symptom and quality of life measures were administered at baseline and study end. Results: A total of n=30 MS participants completed the study (mean age 49.92 Ã‚Â± 9.9 years, 77[percnt] female) with subtypes of relapsing remitting (n=25; all treated with glatiramer acetate), secondary progressive (n=4), or primary progressive (n=1). Expanded Disability Status Scale scores ranged from 1.0 to 6.0 with a median score of 3.00. Active (n=20) vs. control (n=10) condition participants had significant improvement in cognitive measures of information processing (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, p=0.003; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, p=0.002). Those in the active condition also reported greater reduction in fatigue, depressive symptoms and improved sleep quality after the mindfulness training. Fidelity to daily meditation practice was greatest for those who were initially seeking stress reduction training. Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation has the potential to improve cognitive functioning and symptoms of depression and fatigue for those living with MS. Providing instruction and practice through a telemedicine platform greatly improves access and lowers the cost of this symptomatic treatment approach.",

"Title": "The effectiveness of a self-management occupational therapy intervention on activity performance in individuals with multiple sclerosis-related fatigue: a randomized-controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Purpose to evaluate the effectiveness of an individual self-management occupational therapy intervention program (SMOoTh) versus relaxation on the performance of and satisfaction with relevant daily activities in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue. in a single-blind randomized-controlled trial, 31 patients with MS (SMOoTh: n=17, relaxation: n=14) were randomly allocated to three individual sessions focusing on pacing, prioritizing, ergonomics, and self-management (SMOoTh) or on stress management and relaxation (relaxation). Outcomes (blind assessor): Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (primary), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Checklist Individual Strength and Short-Form Health Measure. COPM improved in the SMOoTh and relaxation group after the intervention and 3 months later (COPM performance: F=13.1, P=0.001 and COPM satisfaction: F=10.4, P=0.001); nonsignificant group differences showed a trend in favor of SMOoTh. Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Checklist Individual Strength, and most of the Short-Form Health Measure subscales did not change. Clinically relevant changes in COPM performance scores were found in 71 and 27% of patients in the SMOoTh versus the relaxation group. Both interventions seem to be feasible approaches to improve performance of and satisfaction with relevant daily activities in people with MS, with a sustained effect after 3 months. Neither program altered change fatigue (impact) or quality of life. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To pilot and compare the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy self-management programme with (MSInvigor8-Plus) and without (MSInvigor8-Only) the use of email support in reducing fatigue severity and impact (primary outcomes), and depressed and anxious mood (secondary outcomes). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial using an independent randomization system built into the website and intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Participants were recruited through the local Multiple Sclerosis Society and hospital neurological services in New Zealand. SUBJECTS: A total of 39 people (aged 31-63?years), experiencing multiple sclerosis fatigue, able to walk with and without walking aids, were randomized to MSInvigor8-Only (n = 20) or to MSInvigor8-Plus (n = 19). INTERVENTIONS: MSInvigor8 is an eight-session programme based on cognitive behaviour therapy principles including psycho-education, self-monitoring, and changing unhelpful activity and thought patterns. MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measures included fatigue severity (Chalder Fatigue Scale) and impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Assessments were performed at baseline and at 10?weeks. RESULTS: The MSInvigor8-Plus condition resulted in significantly greater reductions in fatigue severity (F [1,36] = 9.09, p < 0.01) and impact (F [1,36] = 6.03, p < 0.02) compared with the MSInvigor8-Only condition. Large between-group effect sizes for fatigue severity (d = 0.99) and fatigue impact (d = 0.81) were obtained. No significant differences were found between the groups on changes in anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: MSInvigor8 delivered with email-based support is a potentially promising, acceptable, and cost-effective approach to treating fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis in New Zealand.",

"Abstract": "The majority of people affected by Multiple Sclerosis (paMS) experience severe and disabling fatigue. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that cognitive behaviour therapy with a clinical psychologist was an effective treatment for MS fatigue. An Internet-based version of this intervention, MS Invigor8, was developed for the current study using agile design and input from paMS. MS Invigor8 includes eight tailored, interactive sessions. The aim was to test the feasibility and potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the programme in a pilot RCT. 40 patients were randomised to MS Invigor8 (n=23) or standard care (n=17). The MS Invigor8 group accessed sessions over 8-10 weeks and received up to three 30-60min telephone support sessions. Participants completed online standardised questionnaires assessing fatigue, mood, quality of life and service use at baseline and 10 weeks follow-up. Large between group treatment effects were found for the primary outcomes of fatigue severity (d=1.19) and impact (d=1.02). The MS Invigor8 group also reported significantly greater improvements in anxiety, depression and quality-adjusted life years. These data suggest that Internet-based CBT may be a clinically and cost-effective treatment for MS fatigue. A larger RCT with longer term follow-up is warranted.",

"Title": "Distress improves after mindfulness training for progressive MS: A pilot randomised trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to effectively reduce anxiety, depression and pain in patients with chronic physical illnesses. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a specially adapted Skype distant-delivered mindfulness intervention, designed to reduce distress for people affected by primary and secondary progressive MS. METHODS: Forty participants were randomly assigned to the eight-week intervention (n = 19) or a waiting-list control group (n = 21). Participants completed standardised questionnaires to measure mood, impact of MS and symptom severity, quality of life and service costs at baseline, post-intervention and three-month follow-up. RESULTS: Distress scores were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group at post-intervention and follow-up (p < 0.05), effect size -0.67 post-intervention and -0.97 at follow-up. Mean scores for pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression and impact of MS were reduced for the mindfulness group compared with control group at post-therapy and follow-up; effect sizes ranged from -0.27 to -0.99 post-intervention and -0.29 to -1.12 at follow-up. There were no differences in quality-adjusted life years, but an 87.4% probability that the intervention saves on service costs and improves outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A mindfulness intervention delivered through Skype video conferences appears accessible, feasible and potentially effective and cost-effective for people with progressive MS.

"Title": "A group-delivered self-management program reduces spasticity in people with multiple sclerosis: A randomized, controlled pilot trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spasticity affects more than 80% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting activity, participation, and quality of life. Based on an international guideline, an MS spasticity group education and stretching program, MS Spasticity: Take Control (STC), has been developed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to determine whether STC with home stretching is associated with greater changes in spasticity than usual care (UC), consisting of an illustrated stretching booklet and home stretching but without group instruction or support, in people with MS. METHODS: Ambulatory MS patients with self-reported spasticity interfering with daily activities were randomized to STC or UC. Individuals completed questionnaires regarding MS, spasticity, walking, fatigue and mood, and physical measures of spasticity and walking. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 40 participants completed both assessments. Mean total score and scores on two subscales of the MS Spasticity Scale-88 improved more with STC than with UC (p?<?0.03). There was no significant change in the Modified Ashworth Scale in either group. Mean scores on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in the STC group only. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in STC improved self-reported impact of spasticity more than UC and provided encouraging improvements in other measures.",

"Title": "Clinical trial of a formal group fatigue program in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Fatigue: Take Control is a novel program to teach fatigue management to people with multiple sclerosis (MS) following recommendations in the Fatigue and Multiple Sclerosis guideline. Fatigue: Take Control includes six 2-hour group sessions with DVD viewing, discussion and homework and accompanying participant and leader workbooks. While many people have participated in Fatigue: Take Control programs, its efficacy has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine whether participation in Fatigue: Take Control reduces fatigue and increases self-efficacy in people with MS. Thirty participants were randomly assigned to a group who immediately participated in the program (FTC) or a wait-list group (WL). The primary outcome was the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and secondary outcomes were the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSE) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The MFIS was administered on 10 occasions. Other measures were administered on four occasions. A mixed model tested the effects using all observations. Compared with the WL, the FTC group had significantly more improvement on the MFIS [F(1, 269) = 7.079, p = 0.008] and the MSSE [F(1, 111) = 5.636, p = 0.019]. No significant effect was found for the FSS. Across all visits, fatigue was significantly lower and self-efficacy was significantly higher for the FTC group compared with the WL group. This pilot study demonstrated significant effects in fatigue and self-efficacy among subjects taking the Fatigue: Take Control program, suggesting that this comprehensive program based on the Fatigue and Multiple Sclerosis guideline may be beneficial in MS.",

DESIGN: A pilot, randomized, controlled study with a 6-month intervention period. PARTICIPANTS: Participants who met criteria for clinically definite MS. INTERVENTIONS: The 3 intervention arms were usual care, naturopathic medicine plus usual care, and MS education plus usual care. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was quality of life (36-item short form health survey [SF-36]). Secondary outcome measures included fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale); depression (Beck Depression Inventory); cognition battery (Stroop test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 3), and neurologic impairment (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite). Adverse event reporting and laboratory measures were used to assess safety. RESULTS: Forty-five (45) participants (15 per group) were randomized and all completed the 6-month intervention. There were no significant differences between groups on any outcome measure. There was a trend in favoring the naturopathic group in the General Health subscale of the SF-36 (p = 0.11), Timed Walk (p = 0.11), and neurologic impairment (EDSS) (p = 0.07). There was a trend favoring the Education group in the Stroop attention test (p = 0.07). There was no difference between groups in adverse events or laboratory changes. CONCLUSIONS: Naturopathic medicine combined with usual care for MS showed a trend in improvement in the General Health subscale of the SF-36, Timed Walk, and neurologic impairment. Evaluation of naturopathic medicine, as a multimodality regimen, warrants further investigation.",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial of an e-learning designed behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity behavior in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered, behavioral interventions represent a cost-effective, broadly disseminable approach for teaching persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) the theory-based skills, techniques, and strategies for changing physical activity. OBJECTIVES: This pilot, randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of a newly developed Internet website based on e-learning approaches that delivered a theory-based behavior intervention for increasing physical activity and improving symptoms, walking impairment, and neurological disability. METHODS: Participants with MS (N?=?47) were randomly assigned into behavioral intervention (n?=?23) or waitlist control (n?=?24) conditions delivered over a six-month period. Outcomes were administered before and after the six-month period using blinded assessors, and data were analyzed using analysis of covariance in SPSS. RESULTS: There was a significant, positive intervention effect on self-reported physical activity (P?=?0.05, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.10), and non-significant improvement in objectively measured physical activity (P?=?0.24, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.04). There were significant, positive effects of the intervention on overall (P?=?0.018, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.13) and physical impact of fatigue (P?=?0.003, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.20), self-reported walking impairment (P?=?0.047, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.10), and disability status (P?=?0.033, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.11). There were non-significant improvements in fatigue severity (P?=?0.10, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.06), depression (P?=?0.10, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.07) and anxiety (P?=?0.06, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.09) symptoms, and self-reported disability (P?=?0.10, [Formula: see text](?)=?0.07). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for the efficacy of an Internet-based behavioral intervention with content delivered through interactive video courses grounded in e-learning principles for increasing physical activity and possibly improving secondary outcomes of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and walking impairment/disability in persons with MS.",

"Title": "DIMMI SI-a randomized controlled trial on integrated imaginative distention in MS: A selfmanaged tool to cope with fatigue, stress and insomnia in MS persons. First results",
"Abstract": "The diagnosis and the unpredictable and variable nature of Multiple sclerosis (MS) have profound social and psychological impact on persons with MS (pwMS). Fatigue, depression and disability are independent determinants of quality of life (QoL) and stress may differently impact on disease activity. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Imaginative DistentionÃ¢â‚¬Â (ID) is a mind-body technique that combines relaxation (based on Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique which resulted effective on fatigue in MS), imagination and motor imagery. ID can be easily learned and practised, without any particular instrument and is also feasible in disabled pwMS. This is the first randomized controlled study (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness of ID on fatigue, disease specific QoL, insomnia, stress perception and physiological parameters. Primary outcome is the change in fatigue recorded post-intervention. Fatigue has a generically stress-related and a specifically disease-related component. To estimate the effect of ID on the specific MS-related component of fatigue, we enrolled 48 pw MS and two additional groups of subjects, one with mild disease-related stress (insomnia persons) and one at risk of generic stress (health professionals). Each study group was randomised 1:1 to intervention or waiting list. The design is parallel, randomised, controlled, open, stratified by condition. Enrollment was voluntary and started on september 2014. Preevaluation visit included self administered questionnaires for: fatigue, insomnia, stress perception, quality of life, and the EDSS evaluation with a brief cognitive screening for pwMS. PwMS group (14 male) has a median age of 45 years (range: 24-76) in total; for ID group the median is 42 years (24-60) and for the waiting list (WL) group is 48 years (30-67). Median time from onset is 13 years (range 0-43) in total, 9 years for ID group (0-27), 14 years for WL group. Median EDSS is the same: 3,5 (range 0-7,5) with different range for ID group (1-6,5). 10/48 pwMS were not following a drug therapy. After randomization, pwMS started ID training in 4 groups, once a week, for 2 months, from october 2014. One pwMS was retreat and one skip a training session without recovering it. Follow up were applied at 2-5-8 months. If efficacy will be proved, ID could become a tool of empowerment to cope with MS, to reduce its negative impact on daily life and job performances and, possibly, to improve the adherence to pharmacological therapies.",

"Title": "Comparing individualized rehabilitation to a group wellness intervention for persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: Compare the efficacy of two interventions designed to promote health and physical activity (PA). DESIGN: This study was a randomized clinical trial using a time series design. Subjects were randomized into individualized physical rehabilitation (IPR) and group wellness intervention (GWI). Primary questionnaires were administered twice preintervention and twice postintervention. Physical fitness and PA frequency were assessed preintervention and postintervention. SETTING: Clinic based in a metropolitan area. SUBJECTS: Fifty volunteers with multiple sclerosis. INTERVENTIONS: IPR consisted of four physical therapy sessions plus three telephone calls. GWI consisted of seven educational sessions. MEASURES: Primary: SF-36 Health Survey, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Mental Health Inventory. Secondary: physical assessment, PA frequency. ANALYSIS: Stability of primary questionnaires between the two pretests was examined. Efficacy of interventions was evaluated by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and effect sizes. RESULTS: Primary measures were stable between pretests. MANOVA showed nonsignificant differences between interventions. Eight weeks postintervention, both groups had improved PA, fatigue, resting heart rate, and strength. Effect sizes suggested that IPR had a greater effect on preventing decline of physical health, whereas GWI had a greater effect on improving mental health. CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence indicated that health and PA improved in both groups. Effect sizes suggested that participants benefited more physically from IPR and more mentally from GWI. Future research should determine whether combining therapeutic exercise with group education improves both mental and physical health.",

"Title": "Multidisciplinary fatigue management programme in multiple sclerosis: a randomized clinical trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish the efficacy of a multidisciplinary fatigue management programme (MFMP) in MS.Method Fifty-one subjects with MS were randomly allocated to group A, who only received the four weeks MFMP, or group B receiving a placebo intervention programme first and the MFMP after 6 months. In both groups, assessment was performed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 months after the programmes and included Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), MS Self-Efficacy scale (MSSE), Mental Health Inventory (MHI) and Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA). RESULTS: The MFIS showed a significant change over time (F(4,152) = 3.346, P = 0.012), which was similar in both groups (time*group interaction: F(4,152) = 1.094, P = 0.361). A clinically relevant reduction of MFIS score of 10 points or more was found in 17% of individuals following the MFMP, compared to 44% after the placebo intervention programme (P = 0.06). Compared to no intervention, a significant effect of the MFMP after 6 months (P = 0.003) was found in five participants (31%). No significant changes in FSS, MSSE, MHI and IPA, in both groups, were found. CONCLUSION: Although an additional effect was found, the multidisciplinary fatigue management programme showed no efficacy in reducing the impact of fatigue compared to a placebo intervention programme.",

"Title": "Effectiveness of psychological training with gradual muscle relaxation technique on Fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most important symptoms of multiple sclerosis where in majority of patients that often suffer from it are young individuals in active life stage. This study was carried out with an aim to assess the effectiveness of psychological Training with gradual muscle relaxation technique on fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients. Material and methods: In this triple blind placebo-controlled clinical trial study, 60 multiple sclerosis patients that were Multiple Sclerosis Association Members of Yazd Province via an easy sampling method and considering the input and output criteria entered the study. The samples were randomly divided into two groups of test (30 persons) and control (30 persons) respectively, and test group received 12 sessions of psychological education with gradual muscle relaxation technique, two sessions a week, whereas for control group nil intervention were adopted. The information was collected using a demographic questionnaire and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Prior to intervention, immediately and three months after an intervention. For analysis of information the statistical tests; Pearson correlation, Repeated measures and t-student was used. Results: Considering that the patients were randomly divided into two groups of test and control, prior to education did not exhibit a statistical difference in the demographic characteristics, disease duration, body mass index, fatigue scale of patients. (P > 0.05). The fatigue scale in the test and control groups prior to the intervention were 41.9?6.666 and 42.833?8.363, respectively, immediately after the intervention were 41?6.103 and 33.9?7.073, respectively, and three months after an intervention were 41.1?6.567 and 35.567?7.61, respectively and this difference from statistical viewpoint was significant (P < 0.001). Likewise, the Repeated measures statistical test showed a significant reduction in the Fatigue Severity Scale in the education group in triple measurements (P < 0.00001). Conclusion: The psychological Training with gradual muscle relaxation technique in the multiple sclerosis patients can lead to reduction of fatigue scale. Therefore, this method can be safely suggested as an effective and affordable in terms of cost and time for multiple sclerosis patients.",

"Title": "Improving fatigue and depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis using telephone-administered physical activity counseling",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a physical activity intervention consisting of telephone counseling with home-based monitoring to improve fatigue and depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: Single-blind randomized controlled trial. Sixty-four individuals with MS received either telephone counseling (N = 31), or self-directed physical activity education (N = 33). The education condition (EC) consisted of advice to increase physical activity and a DVD with examples of in-home exercises for multiple physical ability levels. The telephone counseling condition (TC) included EC as well as mailed graphic feedback, 6 telephone counseling sessions using principles of motivational interviewing, and telehealth home monitoring to track progress on physical activity goals. Booster sessions were provided when participants indicated they did not meet their goals. Assessment was conducted at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: TC participants reported significantly reduced fatigue (d = -.70), reduced depression (d = -.72) and increased physical activity (d = .92) relative to EC participants. Of individuals receiving TC, 33.3% experienced clinically significant improvement in fatigue (vs. 18.2% in EC) and 53.3% experienced clinically significant improvement in depression (vs. 9.1% in EC). Improvements in physical activity mediated improvements in fatigue with a similar trend for depression. TC was highly feasible (participants completed 99.5% of schedule telephone sessions) and well tolerated (100% rated it highly successful). CONCLUSION: Telephone-based counseling with home monitoring is a promising modality to improve physical activity and treat fatigue and depression.",

"Title": "Comparing the effects of reflexology and relaxation on fatigue in women with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most common and highly disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) that has negative effects on employment, the process of socialization, compliance with the disease, and other factors effective on activities of daily living. The usage of complementary and alternative medicine methods in MS patients is higher than in the general population. However, there is no scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of reflexology and relaxation on fatigue in women with MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial that was done on 75 patients with MS who referred to the MS Clinic of Ayatollah Kashani Hospital (Isfahan, Iran). After simple non-random sampling, participants were randomly assigned by minimization method to three groups: Reflexology, relaxation, and control groups (25 patients in each group). In the experimental groups, the interventions foot reflexology and relaxation (Jacobson and Benson) were performed for 4 weeks, twice a week for 40 min in each session, and the control group received care and routine medical treatment as directed by a physician. Data were collected through a questionnaire and the fatigue severity scale before, immediately after, and 2 months after interventions from all three groups. Data analysis was performed by SPSS version 18 using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. RESULTS: Findings obtained from analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that there was no significant difference in the mean fatigue severity scores in the pre-interventions between the three groups (P > 0.05), but there was significant difference immediately after and 2 months after interventions between the three groups (P < 0.05). Findings obtained from repeated measures (ANOVA) showed that there was significant difference in the mean fatigue severity scores during different times between the three groups (P < 0.05), while this difference was not significant in the control group (P > 0.05). Furthermore, least significant difference post-hoc test revealed that the mean scores of fatigue severity immediately after intervention was lower in the reflexology group than in the other two groups and were lower in the relaxation group than in the control group; 2 months after interventions, the mean scores of fatigue severity were lower in the reflexology group than in the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between the two groups of relaxation and control (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that both interventions were effective in reducing fatigue, but the effects of reflexology on reducing fatigue were more than those of relaxation. Hence, as these two methods are effective and affordable techniques, they can be recommended.",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention targeting symptoms and physical activity in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise training is beneficial, but most persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) are sedentary and physically inactive. This has prompted a new focus on the promotion of lifestyle physical activity in MS. We previously designed, tested, and refined a behavioral intervention delivered through the Internet that successfully increased lifestyle physical activity in MS, but have not evaluated the effects on secondary symptomatic and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a 6-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examined the efficacy of an Internet-delivered, behavioral intervention for improving outcomes of fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain, sleep quality, and HRQOL in 82 ambulatory persons with MS. The secondary aim was to replicate previous results regarding change in free-living physical activity. RESULTS: There was a significant and positive effect of the intervention on fatigue severity (p=.001, eta p (2)=.15) and its physical impact (p=.008, eta p (2)=.09), depression (p=.006, eta p (2)=.10), and anxiety (p=.006, eta p (2)=.10). There were non-significant improvements in pain (p=.08, eta p (2)=.04), sleep quality (p=.06, eta p (2)=.05), and physical HRQOL (p=.06, eta p (2)=.05). We replicated our previous results by demonstrating an increase in self-reported physical activity (p=.001, eta p (2)=.13). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support behavioral interventions targeting lifestyle physical activity as an alternative approach for managing symptoms in MS.",

"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is a frequently reported and disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of an individual energy conservation management (ECM) intervention on fatigue and participation in persons with primary MS-related fatigue. Methods: A total of 86 severely fatigued and ambulatory adults with a definite diagnosis of MS were randomized in a single-blind, two-parallel-arm randomized clinical trial to the ECM group or the information-only control group in outpatient rehabilitation departments. Blinded assessments were carried out at baseline and at 8, 16, 26 and 52 weeks after randomization. Primary outcomes were fatigue (fatigue subscale of Checklist Individual Strength Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CIS20r) and participation (Impact on Participation and Autonomy scale Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IPA). Results: Modified intention-to-treat analysis was based on 76 randomized patients (ECM, n = 36; MS nurse, n=40). No significant ECM effects were found for fatigue (overall difference CIS20r between the groups = -0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), -3.71 to 2.11) or for four out of five IPA domains. An overall unfavourable effect was found in the ECM group for the IPA domain social relations (difference between the groups = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.35). Conclusion: The individual ECM format used in this study did not reduce MS-related fatigue and restrictions in participation more than an information-only control condition.",

"Title": "Effect of self-care program based on Orem?s model on complications of disease in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major cause of disability worldwide that causes many complications and problems for patients and leads to disability. Therefore, the use of self-care strategies for these patients is important. This study aimed to determine the effect of Orem model-based self-care training program on complications of the disease in patients with MS. Materials and Method: In this quasi-experimental before and after study, 88 patients with multiple sclerosis who were a member of Zahedan MS association in 2014 were selected through the convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into two groups of intervention and control, each with 44 subjects. Nine training program sessions were designed and conducted based on the patients? needs. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by patients using a check list. Before and 3 months after the intervention, patients? needs assessment forms were evaluated. Data was analyzed using independent t-test, paired t-test, and chisquare using SPSS 16. Results: The mean age of the intervention group was 34.1?8.2, while the mean age of the control group was 35.6?8.4 years. Self-care program resulted in a significant reduction in complications such as muscle cramps, fatigue, constipation and self-esteem (P=0.001). Conclusion: According to the results, implementation of Orem self-care program can improve the complications in MS patients. Given the limitations of this study, more research in this regard is recommended.",

"Title": "Does aerobic training alleviate fatigue and improve societal participation in patients with multiple sclerosis? The TREFAMS-A multicentre randomised trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Aerobic training may prove a viable treatment to alleviate the commonly reported fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, limited evidence is available for its effectiveness in fatigued patients with MS. Methods: Treating fatigue in multiple sclerosis - Aerobic training (TREFAMS-A) is a multicentre, observer-blinded, randomised controlled trial in 90 ambulant patients with MS suffering from severe fatigue. Patients were allocated 1:1 to 16 weeks individual, partly supervised, aerobic training or a control intervention consisting of three consultations with an MS-specialized nurse. Primary outcomes were perceived fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength [CIS] fatigue subscale) with, and societal participation (Impact on Participation and Autonomy [IPA] scale). An improvement of = 8 points on the CIS fatigue subscale was considered clinically relevant. Secondary outcomes included measures of physical fitness, and complementary fatigue measures. Assessments were performed at baseline, 8, 16, 26, and 52 weeks. Random coefficient analysis was used to assess the group-by-time interaction effects. This study is registered with Controlled-trials. com number ISRCTN69520623. Findings: Between 1 October 2011 and 1 October 2014, over 925 patients were approached, 207 patients with MS were assessed for eligibility, and 90 were included. The mean difference (MD) between-groups, post-intervention on the CIS fatigue subscale was 4.708 (Standard Error [SE] = 1.890; P = .014) in favour of aerobic training. This was preceded by a significant increase in peak power output following 8 weeks of training (MD = 11.701; SE = 5.868; P = .048). At 8 weeks, also a significant reduction on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale psychosocial subscale (MD = -0.771; SE = 0.325, P = .019) was shown. No significant effect was found on societal participation. Interpretation: Aerobic training in MS patients with severe fatigue does not lead to clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue and does not improve societal participation when compared to three consultations offered by an MS-specialized nurse.",

"Title": "The effects of telephone-based physical activity counselling on fatigue, pain, symptoms and quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis and major depression",
"Abstract": "Background and goals: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with fatigue, pain, other somatic and psychological symptoms and diminished health-related quality of life. Self-management treatments have been found to improve symptoms and quality of life. Physical activity interventions represent another promising approach to reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. We conducted a single-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week physical activity counseling intervention delivered primarily by telephone to a wait-list control group in people with MS and major depression. Methods: We assessed 634 adults with MS for eligibility. Ninetytwo adults with MS and MDD or dysthymia completed an inperson baseline assessment and were randomized to wait-list control (n=48) or a motivational interviewing-based physical activity promotion intervention (n=44). The treatment group received an initial in-person session; seven interim telephone counseling sessions and an in-person session at week 12. Outcomes measured at baseline and 12 weeks were: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale-short version, Medical Outcomes Study SF-36; MS-Related Symptoms Checklist, EuroQol 5-D, Brief Pain Inventory and Community Integration Questionnaire. All outcomes were reassessed at 24 weeks in the treatment group. Results: The sample was on average 48 years old, 10 years post diagnosis, 86% women, 75% non-Hispanic White, and 74% had a relapsing-remitting MS. Randomization was imbalanced on depression severity, but controlling for this imbalance in regressions did not influence results. We used linear regressions (Wald test) to predict 12-week outcomes (intent-to-treat) after controlling for the baseline score for that outcome. These analyses showed that the intervention group reported significantly greater improvement in fatigue impact (p=.0001), MS-related symptoms ((p=.01), and SF-36 mental composite (p=.0002) compared to the control group. Mean scores on these measures were virtually unchanged from 12 to 24 weeks. No between group differences were observed on other measures. The counselor spent a mean of 138 minutes with each subject. Conclusions: Telephone-based physical activity counseling represents a promising and time-efficient approach to achieving durable improvements in fatigue impact, MS-related symptoms and mental health related quality of life in people with MS and major depression. Future research should examine whether these findings can be replicated and generalized to non-depressed individuals with MS.",

"Title": "Effectiveness of an online fatigue self-management programme for people with chronic neurological conditions: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an online fatigue self-management programme in a sample of adults with chronic neurological conditions. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Online fatigue self-management programme delivered across Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five people with fatigue secondary to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or post-polio syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: An online fatigue self-management programme, an information-only fatigue self-management programme and a control group. MAIN MEASURES: Groups were compared at pre test, post test and at three months on primary outcomes using the Fatigue Impact Scale, Activity Card Sort and Personal Wellbeing Index. RESULTS: With the exception of the Personal Wellbeing Index at post test (F = 3.519; P =0.034) and the Physical Subscale of the Fatigue Impact Scale at follow-up (F = 3.473; P =0.035) there were no significant differences between the three groups on primary outcomes. Post-hoc testing showed the differences to be between the information-only and control groups (P = 0.036 and P = 0.030 respectively). Improvement in the information-only group was unexpected but appears to be similar to results of other online interventions. The fatigue self-management and information-only groups performed better than the control on some secondary outcome measures. Low power in the analysis may have contributed to the findings. Repeated-measures ANCOVA showed that the fatigue self-management and the information-only groups improved over time on the Fatigue Impact Scale and the Activity Card Sort (P<0.05). The control group showed no improvements over time. CONCLUSIONS: Although the fatigue self-management group improved over time, results did not demonstrate additional benefit in most outcome measures when compared with the control group.",

"Title": "MS quality of life, depression, and fatigue improve after mindfulness training: A randomized trial",
"Abstract": "Objective: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is often much reduced among individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), and incidences of depression, fatigue, and anxiety are high. We examined effects of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) compared to usual care (UC) upon HRQOL, depression, and fatigue among adults with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive Ms. Methods: A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 76) or to UC (n = 74). MBI consisted of a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training. Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up. Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue. Anxiety, personal goal attainment, and adherence to homework were secondary outcomes. Results: Attrition was low in the intervention group (5%) and attendance rate high (92%). Employing intention-to-treat analysis, MBI, compared with UC, improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes at postintervention and follow-up (p < 0.002); effect sizes, 0.4-0.9 posttreatment and 0.3-0.5 at follow-up. When analyses were repeated among subgroups with clinically relevant levels of preintervention depression, fatigue, or anxiety, postintervention and follow-up effects remained significant and effect sizes were larger than for the total sample. Conclusions: In addition to evidence of improved HRQOL and well-being, these findings demonstrate broad feasibility and acceptance of, as well as satisfaction and adherence with, a program of mindfulness training for patients with MS. The results may also have treatment implications for other chronic disorders that diminish Hrqol. Classification Of Evidence: This trial provides Class III evidence that MBI compared with UC improved HRQOL, fatigue, and depression up to 6 months postintervention.

"Title": "Efficacy of a Telephone-Delivered Self-Management Intervention for Persons With Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial With a One-Year Follow-Up",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a telephone-delivered self-management intervention for fatigue, pain, and depression in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Single-center, randomized (1:1), single-blind (outcome assessors), parallel-group trial with a primary endpoint of posttreatment (9-11 wk postrandomization) and long-term follow-up at 6 and 12 months. SETTING: Telephone-delivered across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with MS (N=163) with fatigue, chronic pain, and/or moderate depressive symptoms (age range, 25-76 y). INTERVENTIONS: Eight-week individual telephone-delivered self-management intervention (T-SM) (n=75) versus an 8-week individual telephone-delivered MS education intervention (T-ED) (n=88). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion who achieved a >=50% decrease in 1 or more symptoms-fatigue impact, pain interference, and/or depression severity. Secondary outcomes included continuous measures of pain, fatigue impact, depression, self-efficacy, activation, health-related quality of life, resilience, and affect. RESULTS: For our primary outcome, 58% of those in the T-SM group and 46% of those in the T-ED group had a >=50% reduction in 1 or more symptoms; this difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, .77-2.93; P=.238). Participants in both groups significantly improved from baseline to posttreatment in primary and secondary outcome measures (P<.05). T-SM participants reported significantly higher treatment satisfaction and therapeutic alliance and greater improvements in activation, positive affect, and social roles. Improvements were generally maintained at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions resulted in short- and long-term, clinically meaningful benefits. The study demonstrated that the telephone is an effective method for engaging participants in care and extending the reach of rehabilitation for individuals with MS.

"Title": "A pragmatic parallel arm multi-centre randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group-based fatigue management programme (FACETS) for people with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and troubling symptom for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a six-session group-based programme for managing MS-fatigue (Fatigue: Applying Cognitive behavioural and Energy effectiveness Techniques to lifeStyle (FACETS)). METHODS: Three-centre parallel arm randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation. Patients with MS and significant fatigue were randomised to FACETS plus current local practice (FACETS) or current local practice alone (CLP), using concealed computer-generated randomisation. Participant blinding was not possible. Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Fatigue Assessment Instrument), self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy) and disease-specific quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)) at 1 and 4 months postintervention (follow-up 1 and 2). Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated (EuroQoL 5-Dimensions questionnaire and the Short-form 6-Dimensions questionnaire). RESULTS: Between May 2008 and November 2009, 164 patients were randomised; primary outcome data were available for 146 (89%). Statistically significant differences favour the intervention group on fatigue self-efficacy at follow-up 1 (mean difference (MD) 9, 95% CI (4 to 14), standardised effect size (SES) 0.54, p=0.001) and follow-up 2 (MD 6, 95% CI (0 to 12), SES 0.36, p=0.05) and fatigue severity at follow-up 2 (MD -0.36, 95% CI (-0.63 to -0.08), SES -0.35, p=0.01) but no differences for MSIS-29 or QALYs. No adverse events reported. Estimated cost per person for FACETS is 453; findings suggest an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2157 per additional person with a clinically significant improvement in fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: FACETS is effective in reducing fatigue severity and increasing fatigue self-efficacy. However, it is difficult to assess the additional cost in terms of cost-effectiveness (ie, cost per QALY) as improvements in fatigue are not reflected in the QALY outcomes, with no significant differences between FACETS and CLP. The strengths of this trial are its pragmatic nature and high external validity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN76517470.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term efficacy and effectiveness of a six-week energy conservation course on fatigue impact, quality of life and self-efficacy for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we randomly assigned 169 persons with MS to an immediate intervention group or a delayed control group using a crossover design. The outcome measures: Fatigue Impact Scale, SF-36 Health Survey and Self-Efficacy for Performing Energy Conservation Strategies were measured before and after courses and no intervention control periods. We performed intent-to-treat analysis and compliers-only analyses using mixed effects analysis of variance models. RESULTS: Taking the energy conservation course had significant effects on reducing the physical and social subscales of Fatigue Impact Scale and on increasing the Vitality subscale of the SF-36 scores compared with not taking the course. Additional subscales were significant depending on methods of analyses. Self-Efficacy for Performing Energy Conservation Strategies Assessment increased significantly (P <0.05) postcourse compared to precourse. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the efficacy and effectiveness of the energy conservation course to decrease fatigue impact, and to increase self-efficacy and some aspects of quality of life.",

"Title": "A 6-month, multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effect of physical training on fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis treated with Fingolimod (GilenyaÃ‚Â®)-first results of the PACE study",
"Abstract": "Aim: Up to 40% of patients with MS report fatigue as the most disabling problem as it affects daily activities and reduces quality of live. So far there is no effective evidence based treatment for this important condition. However, the combination of an effective immunomodulatory treatment and physical activity is considered to be an important clinical concept in controlling fatigue. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of a web- based exercise program on the fatigue level in patients treated with Fingolimod. Methods: This is a 6-month, randomized, controlled, multicenter study in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients treated with Fingolimod evaluating effects of structured e-training versus no training on fatigue measured by the modified fatigue impact scale (mFIS) at study onset and after 6 months. Secondary outcome parameters include quality of life, functional performance, muscular strength and aerobic capacity. The e-training intervention employs a web-based application to administer an adaptive and individualized exercise protocol with the focus on endurance and strength training but also balance and core stability exercises. All exercises can be performed at home without the need of further devices. Results: 178 RRMS patients were randomized in this study. The intervention did not result in significant differences between fatigue levels of patients using e-training and the waiting group (-1.47 with a 95% CI of [-5.39; 2.44], p=0.4579). However, in a subpopulation of patients with low aerobic capacity (VO2max < 27 l/min/kg) at study onset, a substantial effect of e-training on the primary outcome parameter could be observed. The results of these subgroup analyses indicate an influence of patients' baseline physical fitness on the effect of sportive e-training. Conclusion: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of structured physical e-training vs. no training on fatigue in Fingolimod-treated RRMS patients. In spite of the missing overall effect of the study, we could demonstrate a beneficial effect in a subgroup of patients with low aerobic capacity. Therefore, patients that are less physically fit seem to benefit significantly from structured exercise programs. Aerobic capacity might be a suitable marker for patient selection. Furthermore, this interventional study shows for the first time the safety profile and feasibility of combining individualized physical activity and Fingolimod treatment in RRMS patients.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies support the efficacy and effectiveness of face-to-face group-based fatigue management education for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, many people are unable to access these programs due to environmental barriers. OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy and effectiveness of a group-based, teleconference-delivered fatigue management program for people with MS. METHODS: A randomly allocated two-group time series design with a wait-list control group was used. In total 190 participants were allocated (94 intervention, 96 wait-list control). Primary outcomes (fatigue impact, fatigue severity, health-related quality of life (HRQOL)) were measured before, immediately after, at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post. Secondary outcome (self-efficacy) was measured at the same points. Effectiveness (intent-to-treat) and efficacy (per protocol) analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The program was more effective and efficacious than control for reducing fatigue impact but not fatigue severity. Before and after comparisons with the pooled sample demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for fatigue impact, fatigue severity, and 6 of 8 HRQOL dimensions. Changes were maintained for 6 months with small to moderate effect sizes. CONCLUSION: The results offer strong support for the viability of teleconference-delivered fatigue management education for enabling people with MS to manage this disabling symptom.",

"Title": "A cluster randomised controlled trial on the efficacy of client-centred occupational therapy in multiple sclerosis: good process, poor outcome",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of client-centred occupational therapy (OT) according to a client-centred process framework, as compared to usual care OT, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: A multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with the institution (i.e. hospital or rehabilitation centre) as the unit of randomisation was performed. A total of 269 outpatients with MS, 13 hospitals and rehabilitation centres and 29 occupational therapists participated. Primary outcomes included measures of disability, participation and autonomy. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, generic health-related quality of life, quality and evaluation of therapy, therapy compliance and therapy frequency. Measurements were taken at baseline, four months and at eight months follow-up. RESULTS: Primary outcome measures did not show significant differences between the two interventions. Secondary outcomes revealed significant differences in favour of the usual care OT on fatigue (physical scale and total scale) and health-related quality of life (bodily pain and vitality) at four months. After eight months only significant differences on mental health were found. Process outcomes (i.e. the information scale of therapy quality and the client-centredness of the organisation) were in favour of the client-centred intervention. CONCLUSION: Because the client-centred intervention resulted in no effects on the primary outcomes and small but negative effects on the secondary functional outcomes, we should seriously reconsider the application of client-centred practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: An increasing number of interventions claim to incorporate client-centred practice. Client-centred practice is associated with improved satisfaction but the effects on functional health-related outcomes have not been fully evaluated. The findings of this study show that the process outcomes of therapy were in favour of the client-centred intervention, but no effects were found on the primary outcomes and negative effects on the secondary functional health outcomes. It is suggested that the implementation of client-centred practice should be adjusted in order to achieve optimal health outcomes.",

"Title": "Online fatigue management programme for patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is a major disabling symptom in MS and up to now only face-to-face behavioural interventions and exercise programmes have confirmed treatment effects. In a first pilot trial an online intervention based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) combined with telephone support also showed significant efficacy. Based on a manualized face-to-face CBT intervention we developed an interactive online fatigue management programme. After piloting we aimed at showing efficacy in an online treatment trial, which will be presented. Methods: In a randomized wait-list control group design we included 275 patients with MS fatigue, who were randomly assigned to the 3-month lasting online intervention group (ELEVIDA) or to the waiting group. Recruitment, intervention as well as assessments are completely internet based. Patients were informed and invited to participate by means of the German MS Society. Randomization is performed based on a computer algorithm. To check the MS diagnosis of participants a randomized selected subgroup was requested to send a medical diagnostic confirmation. The primary outcome was the Chalder fatigue scale. Secondary outcomes included the fatigue scale for motor and cognition (FSMC) and measures of disease perception, quality of life, anxiety, mood and cognitive self-assessment. Assessments will be performed directly post-treatment (primary analyses), 3 and 6 months after treatment. The trial is registered with ISRCTN25692173 and approved by the Hamburg ethics committee. Results: Up to 12 December 2014, 109 (81%) from 134 invited participants were assessed before and after treatment. An interim analysis actually shows more but still not significant reductions in fatigue across the 3 months in the intervention group compared with the control group (? 5.72 vs. 3.58; P=0.104). Up to now results indicate that ELEVIDA may help to decrease clinically significant fatigue. Conclusion: The online management programme ELEVIDA might be an effective treatment option for fatigue in MS patients.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol (THC:CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex) is an add-on therapy for moderate-to-severe multiple sclerosis (MS)-related drug-resistant spasticity (MSS). AIM: The MOVE-2 EU study collected data from everyday clinical practice concerning the effectiveness and tolerability of THC:CBD. METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, multicentre, non-interventional study. Patients with resistant MSS prescribed add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray according to approved labelling, were followed for 3 months. After 1 month, only responders (>=20% improvement in spasticity) continued treatment. The main endpoints were the evolution of MSS and associated symptoms, quality of life (QoL) and tolerability. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty three patients (55% female) were recruited (98% in Italy). The mean duration of MSS was 7.4 years and baclofen was used by 78.1% of participants. Three hundred and forty nine participants continued with THC:CBD oromucosal spray after 1 month, and 281 after 3 months. THC:CBD mean dosage was 6 sprays/day. MSS scores and spasticity-related symptoms (spasms, fatigue, pain, sleep quality and bladder dysfunction) were significantly improved by THC:CBD at 3 months, as were activities of daily living, and QoL (EQ-5D VAS). Adverse events, none of which were severe or serious, were reported by 10.4% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In everyday clinical practice, THC:CBD oromucosal spray provided symptomatic relief of MSS and related troublesome symptoms.",

"Abstract": "Introduction: Fatigue is a frequent symptom in MS and correlates with patients' earning capacity and quality of life. Nevertheless, there is no sufficient proof of a connection between subjective cognitive limitations and performance in neuropsychological testing. Therefore an objective measure of fatigue is not yet established. Fatigue increases with temperature rises. One current explanation for fatigue postulates a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that leads to differing responses to cognitive or physical strains, i.e. to heat. Thus, external cooling has been proposed as a treatment strategy and had weak to moderate effects on motor fatigue. However, effects of cooling on cognitive fatigue in mentally challenging tasks have not yet been investigated. Method: In a crossover design 31 MS patients and 10 healthy controls were compared in terms of their cognitive performance in two attentional tasks (Vigilance and Alertness; Testbattery of Attentional Performance (TAP)) during verum- versus placebocooling. Test-performance was correlated with subjective fatigueperception to identify an adequate objective measure. Subjective Fatigue and test performance were compared between coolingconditions. As parameters of the autonomic nervous system heartrate variability and electrodermal activity were assessed during testing. Results: MS Patients showed significantly more omissions in the vigilance test than healthy controls (p = 0.019). Patients' performance declined with the duration of the task, while healthy controls improved slightly (p = 0.017). Also a significant correlation of test-performance and self-rated fatigue was found (p = 0.029). Measures of sympathovagal-balance developed differently between groups. Less autonomic reaction to the mental strain of the vigilance task was found in MS patients (p = 0.040). Active cooling led to ameliorations of subjective fatigue in both groups, irrespective of fatigue. Objective test-performance did not improve under verum-condition. Parameters of autonomic functions were not influenced by external cooling. Discussion: The vigilance test of the TAP is an appropriate objective measure of cognitive fatigue as it reflects subjectively experienced limitations. Active temperature-cooling did not lead to specific subjective or objective ameliorations of cognitive fatigue. A reduced reaction in sympatho-vagal balance to mental strain indicates autonomic dysfunction in MS, yet independent of fatigue.",

"Title": "Cooling garment treatment in MS: clinical improvement and decrease in leukocyte NO production",
"Abstract": "Ten heat-sensitive patients with MS were randomly allocated in a cross-over study to wear a cooling garment for 60 minutes at 7 degrees C (active cooling) and 26 degrees C (sham cooling). In contrast to sham cooling, active cooling improved fatigue and postural stability with eyes closed and muscle strength. There was no decrease in tympanic temperature, but active cooling was associated with a 41% decrease in mean leukocyte nitric oxide (NO) production (p = 0.004). This effect on NO could be relevant because it blocks conduction in demyelinated axons.",

"Title": "Effects of a Training Program Involving Body Cooling on Physical and Cognitive Capacities and Quality of Life in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Pilot Study",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Two methods using exercise and body cooling could influence the well-being of patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The aim of this study was to determine whether wearing a cooling vest during a physical training program could increase the cognitive and physical capacities and quality of life in PwMS. METHODS: Eighteen PwMS (49.6 Ã‚Â± 8 years; Expanded Disability Status Score 5.0 Ã‚Â± 1.0) were randomly assigned to a cooling or control group. PwMS underwent a 7-week physical training program. In the cooling group, PwMS wore a cooling vest during each training session, whereas in the control group, PwMS wore a cotton T-shirt. Before and after the training program, both groups completed the Isaacs Set Test (IST), Trail Making Test A-B (TMT A-B), SEP-59, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and performed a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). RESULTS: The cooling group showed significantly (p < 0.05) improved performance for IST, TMT A and 6MWT. Their emotional well-being and cognitive functions investigated in SEP-59 were significantly (p < 0.05) improved, and general and physical fatigue significantly (p < 0.05) decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This physical training program combined with a cooling strategy could have a significant positive influence on both cognitive and physical performances, perceived fatigue and emotional well-being in heat-sensitive PwMS.",

"Title": "Effect of pulsed magnetic field therapy on the level of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis--a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Twenty-five multiple sclerosis patients, taking part in a rehabilitation program, were randomly assigned to treatment with pulsed magnetic field therapy (PMFT) or to sham therapy in order to study the additional effect of PMFT as part of a multimodal neurological rehabilitation program on fatigue. Patients demographic and disease specific characteristics were recorded. Level of fatigue was measured by fatigue severity scale (FSS) at entrance and discharge and with a visual analog scale (VAS) immediate before and after a single treatment session. The 'Magnetic Cell Regeneration' system by Santerra was used for PMFT. A single treatment lasted 16 minutes twice daily over 3-4 weeks and consisted of relaxed lying on a PMF mattress. Sham intervention was conducted in an identical manner with the PMF-device off. Patients and statistics were blinded. Level of fatigue measured by FSS was high at entrance in both treatment group (TG) and control group (CG) (5.6 versus 5.5). Over time of rehabilitation fatigue was reduced by 18% in TG and 7% in CG which was statistically not significant. There was a statistically significant immediate effect of the single treatment session which 18% reduction of fatigue measured by VAS in TG versus 11% in CG. Because of a high 'placebo effect' of simple bed rest, a only small and short lasting additional effect of PMFT and high costs of a PMF-device, we cannot recommend PMFT as an additional feature of a multimodal neurological rehabilitation program in order to reduce fatigue level of MS-patients.",

"Title": "Double-blind study of pulsing magnetic field effects on multiple sclerosis.[Erratum appears in J Altern Complement Med 1997 Summer;3(2):205]",
"Abstract": "We performed a double-blind study to measure the clinical and subclinical effects of an alternative medicine magnetic device on disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). The MS patients were exposed to a magnetic pulsing device (Enermed) where the frequency of the magnetic pulse was in the 4-13 Hz range (50-100 milliGauss). A total of 30 MS patients wore the device on preselected sites between 10 and 24 hours a day for 2 months. Half of the patients (15) randomly received an Enermed device that was magnetically inactive and the other half received an active device. Each MS patient received a set of tests to evaluate MS disease status before and after wearing the Enermed device. The tests included (1) a clinical rating (Kurtzke, EDSS), (2) patient-reported performance scales, and (3) quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) during a language task. Although there was no significant change between pretreatment and posttreatment in the EDSS scale, there was a significant improvement in the performance scale (PS) combined rating for bladder control, cognitive function, fatigue level, mobility, spasticity, and vision (active group -3.83 +/- 1.08, p < 0.005; placebo group -0.17 +/- 1.07, change in PS scale). There was also a significant change between pretreatment and posttreatment in alpha EEG magnitude during the language task recorded at various electrode sites on the left side. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we have demonstrated a statistically significant effect of the Enermed magnetic pulsing device on patient performance scales and on alpha EEG magnitude during a language task.",

"Title": "Low fat dietary intervention with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in multiple sclerosis patients",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a low fat diet supplemented with omega-3 positively affects quality of life (QOL) in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. In this 1-year long double-blind, randomized trial, patients were randomized to two dietary interventions: the \"Fish Oil\" (FO) group received a low fat diet (15% fat) with omega-3 FOs and the \"Olive Oil\" (OO) group received the AHA Step I diet (fat 30%) with OO supplements. The primary outcome measure was the Physical Components Summary Scale (PCS) of the Short Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36). Additional measures using MS specific QOL questionnaires, neurological status and relapse rate were obtained. RESULTS: 31 RRMS patients were enrolled, with mean follow up over 11 +/- SD 2.9 months. Clinical benefits favoring the FO group were observed on PCS/SF-36 (P = 0.050) and MHI (P = 0.050) at 6 months. Reduced fatigue was seen on the OO diet at 6 months (P = 0.035). The relapse rate decreased in both groups relative to the rates during the 1 year preceding the study: mean change in relapse rate in the FO group: -0.79 +/- SD 1.12 relapses/year (P = 0.021) vs. -0.69 +/- SD 1.11 (P = 0.044) in the OO group. This study suggests that a low fat diet supplemented with omega-3 PUFA can have moderate benefits in RRMS patients on concurrent disease modifying therapies.",

"Title": "Smoked cannabis for spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spasticity is a common and poorly controlled symptom of multiple sclerosis. Our objective was to determine the short-term effect of smoked cannabis on this symptom. METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, crossover trial involving adult patients with multiple sclerosis and spasticity. We recruited participants from a regional clinic or by referral from specialists. We randomly assigned participants to either the intervention (smoked cannabis, once daily for three days) or control (identical placebo cigarettes, once daily for three days). Each participant was assessed daily before and after treatment. After a washout interval of 11 days, participants crossed over to the opposite group. Our primary outcome was change in spasticity as measured by patient score on the modified Ashworth scale. Our secondary outcomes included patients' perception of pain (as measured using a visual analogue scale), a timed walk and changes in cognitive function (as measured by patient performance on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), in addition to ratings of fatigue. RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants were randomized at the start of the study, 30 of whom completed the trial. Treatment with smoked cannabis resulted in a reduction in patient scores on the modified Ashworth scale by an average of 2.74 points more than placebo (p < 0.0001). In addition, treatment reduced pain scores on a visual analogue scale by an average of 5.28 points more than placebo (p = 0.008). Scores for the timed walk did not differ significantly between treatment and placebo (p = 0.2). Scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test decreased by 8.67 points more with treatment than with placebo (p = 0.003). No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. INTERPRETATION: Smoked cannabis was superior to placebo in symptom and pain reduction in participants with treatment-resistant spasticity. Future studies should examine whether different doses can result in similar beneficial effects with less cognitive impact.",

"Title": "Effect of BEMER magnetic field therapy on the level of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Electromagnetic field therapy has been reported to be beneficial in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with significant fatigue. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effects of Bio-Electro-Magnetic-Energy-Regulation (BEMER) on MS-related fatigue. DESIGN: This was a monocenter, patient- and rater-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. PATIENTS: There were 37 relapsing-remitting patients with MS with significant fatigue in the study. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of BEMER magnetic field treatment for 8 minutes twice daily in comparison to placebo for 12 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome criterion was change in the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) between baseline and 12 weeks. The secondary outcome criteria were changes of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), a general depression scale-long version (ADS-L), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Scale (MSFC), and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). RESULTS: There was evidence of a significant difference of MFIS value (primary outcome criterion) after 12 weeks in favor of the verum group (26.84 versus 36.67; p = 0.024). In addition, FSS values were significantly lower in the verum group after 12 weeks (3.5 versus 4.7; p = 0.016). After 6 weeks' follow-up, verum and placebo groups did not differ in experienced fatigue (MFIS, FSS). Regarding the subscales of the MFIS, there was a significant decrease in physical (p = 0.018) and cognitive (p = 0.041), but not in psychologic subscales only in the verum group regarding the timepoints baseline and 12 weeks. BEMER therapy was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: In this pilot study, we were able to demonstrate a beneficial effect of BEMER intervention on MS fatigue. As this was only a pilot study, trials with more patients and longer duration are mandatory to describe long-term effects.",

"Abstract": "Objective: One of the symptoms causing the greatest morbidity and disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is fatigue. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was to assess whether a low-frequency magnetic field can reduce fatigue in MS subjects. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Subjects were evaluated with Time Walking Test, Visual Analog Test, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) at TO (begin of Biorm Therapy or sham therapy), T1 (end of Biorm Therapy or sham therapy), T2 (begin of Biorm Therapy or sham therapy) and T3 (end of Biorm Therapy or sham therapy). Setting: Italian Multiple Sclerosis Society Rehabilitation Center for outpatients. Participants: Forty-two subjects were recruited among those followed as outpatients at AISM rehabilitation center. Inclusion criteria: stable phase of the disease, ambulatory subjects with EDSS < 7; exclusion criteria: secondary causes of fatigue. Interventions: Subjects were treated for 24 min/session 3 times/wk for 8 weeks. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups: Biorm group (21 subjects) and placebo group - sham therapy (21 subjects). Each group crossover received both sham therapy and Biorm therapy with a wash out period of 4 months (T1 - T2). Statistical analysis was performed using a multivariate analysis taking into account Time (T0, T1, T2 and T3) and Treatment (Biorm or sham) as fixed factor; TWT, VAS, MFIS and FSS were considered as dependent factors. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome: MFIS. Secondary outcomes: Visual Analog Test and FSS and Time Walking Test. Results: Results showed a statistically significant improvement in MFIS (P<.05) for both groups, although no statistically significant differences were found taking into consideration Treatment factor. Conclusions: Low-frequency magnetic field exposure has no advantage over sham exposure in reducing impact of fatigue in MS subjects.",

"Title": "Effect of THC-CBD oromucosal spray (Sativex) on measures of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: A doubleblind, placebo-controlled, crossover study",
"Abstract": "Background: THC-CBD oromucosal spray (Sativex) has proven effective in reducing symptoms associated with spasticity in multiple sclerosis-MS. Little is known on the correlates of such effects on objective measures of spasticity (e.g. spinal H reflex) or corticospinal excitability. Objectives: to assess clinical-neurophysiological correlates of Sativex on spasticity in MS. Methods: Subjects with progressive MS (43, 20 females, EDSS 3.5-6) and clinical evidence of spasticity (modified Ashworth scale-MAS >1) were randomized to a 2-week titration plus 2-week stable dose of either active THC-CBD (Sativex) or placebo formulation, followed by a second cross-over cycle after 2-week washout, in a double-blind fashion. Clinical-neurophysiological measures were obtained before and at the end of each phase: MAS, spasticity and pain numeric rating scales-NRS, 10-mt walk, fatigue severity scale, bilateral soleus H/M ratio; Motor Evoked Potential amplitude at 120% threshold and 100% stimulator output, and intracortical inhibition/facilitation. Five subjects dropped (2 during real treatment: 1 for dizziness, 1 subjective weakness; 3 on post-real washout: 1 acute pancreatitis, 1 to enter a rehabilitation program, 1 for family reasons), 4 were not analyzed due to positive THC urine testing on washout. The effect of treatment on changes from baseline was tested using paired Student's t; treatment sequence effect was tested using repeated measures ANOVA, after verifying homogeneity of baselines between subgroups and over time. Results: A significant treatment effect was found on MAS with higher improvement after real vs placebo (-1.51 Ã‚Â± 2.20 vs 0.16Ã‚Â±2.55; p = 0.009); improvement in MAS and in NRS spasticity were significantly correlated (r 0.38, p 0.025). MAS responders (at least 20% improvement) were significantly more frequent during real treatment (41.2%) vs placebo (11.8%; ?2=5.56, p 0.018). Neurophysiological measures did not significantly differ according to treatment and were not significantly correlated crosssectionally/ longitudinally with clinical parameters, except for a trend between percent changes in MAS and in H/M (r 0.34, p 0.051). Conclusions: Our findings confirm clinical beneficial effect of THC-CBD on MS spasticity. The lack of corresponding changes on corticospinal excitability and on the monosynaptic component of the stretch reflex point to the relevance of other spinal and supraspinal mechanisms involved in spasticity physiopathology.",

"Title": "Evaluation of a single session with cooling garment for persons with multiple sclerosis--a randomized trial",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: This research investigates the objective and subjective effects of wearing the Rehband cooling garment. METHOD: A multi-centre, randomized crossover study was conducted regarding 43 heat-sensitive persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), comparing active treatment with placebo. Subjects were tested immediately before and after intervention. Ten-(10TW) and 30-metre timed walk (30TW), oral temperature, spasticity, standing balance and timed up and go (TUG) and nine-hole peg test (NHPT) performance were measured. A study-specific questionnaire was used to evaluate subjective experiences. RESULTS: Active treatment produced statistically significant objective improvement in 10TW, 30TW, one-legged stance, tandem stance (right) and TUG; statistically significant subjective improvement was also found in fatigue, spasticity, weakness, balance, gait, transfers, ability to think clearly and time to recover. The coherence between the objective and subjective results indicates clinical relevance from the subjects' perspective. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in terms of oral temperature, spasticity (measured by the modified Ashworth scale), tandem stance (left), step test or NHPT, or subjective signs such as difficulty in dressing, dysarthria or pain. CONCLUSIONS: Active cooling with a Rehband: vest is likely to have a positive effect on everyday life in heat-sensitive persons with MS.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of the most common disabling symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). There is growing evidence in the literature for beneficial effects of magnetic fields on different MS symptoms and this has been reported to be beneficial in patients with MS, especially those with fatigue. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the effects on primary fatigue with a pulsed systemic low frequency magnetic field by means of clinical scales in a population of MS subjects. METHODS: Randomized double-blind cross-over trial with 50 MS subjects with primary fatigue who were recruited among those followed as outpatients at the AISM Rehabilitation Centre, Genova, Italy. Subjects were randomized into two groups: magnetic field group and sham therapy group and evaluated with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), VAS and Time Walking Test 10 meter (TWT10m.) at the time points of the study. Each group received both sham therapy and magnetic field therapy with a wash-out period of 5 months. Subjects were treated for 24 min per session, three times per week, for 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Results showed a statistically significant improvement in MFIS Physical Score for T0-T1 (p < 0.05) for TIME but not for TREATMENT and TIME*TREATMENT factors. No statistically significant differences were found for all other parameters considered in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to a low frequency magnetic field, within the parameters of this treatment protocol, has no advantage over sham exposure in reducing the impact of fatigue.",

"Title": "A randomized controlled study of the acute and chronic effects of cooling therapy for MS",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cooling demyelinated nerves can reduce conduction block, potentially improving symptoms of MS. The therapeutic effects of cooling in patients with MS have not been convincingly demonstrated because prior studies were limited by uncontrolled designs, unblinded evaluations, reliance on subjective outcome measures, and small sample sizes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a single acute dose of cooling therapy using objective measures of neurologic function in a controlled, double-blinded setting, and to determine whether effects are sustained during daily cooling garment use. METHODS: Patients (n = 84) with definite MS, mild to moderate disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score < 6.0), and self-reported heat sensitivity were randomized into a multicenter, sham-treatment controlled, double-blind crossover study. Patients had the MS Functional Composite (MSFC) and measures of visual acuity/contrast sensitivity assessed before and after high-dose or low-dose cooling for 1 hour with a liquid cooling garment. One week later, patients had identical assessments before and after the alternate treatment. Patients were then re-randomized to use the cooling garment 1 hour each day for a month or to have observation only. They completed self-rated assessments of fatigue, strength, and cognition during this time, and underwent another acute cooling session at the end of the period. After 1 week of rest, they had identical assessments during the alternate treatment. RESULTS: Body temperature declined during both high-dose and low-dose cooling, but high-dose produced a greater reduction (p < 0.0001). High-dose cooling produced a small improvement in the MSFC (0.076 +/- 0.66, p = 0.007), whereas low-dose cooling produced only a trend toward improvement (0.053 +/- 0.031, p = 0.09), but the difference between conditions was not significant. Timed gait testing and visual acuity/contrast sensitivity improved in both conditions as well. When patients underwent acute cooling following a month of daily cooling, treatment effects were similar. Patients reported less fatigue during the month of daily cooling, concurrently on the Rochester Fatigue Diary and retrospectively on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Cooling therapy was associated with objectively measurable but modest improvements in motor and visual function as well as persistent subjective benefits.",

"Title": "omega-3 fatty acid treatment in multiple sclerosis (OFAMS Study): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether omega-3 fatty acids reduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis, both as monotherapy and in combination with interferon beta-1a treatment. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from 2004 to 2008. SETTING: Thirteen public neurology departments in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 to 55 years with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with a disability score equivalent to 5.0 or less on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale. Ninety-two patients were randomized to omega-3 fatty acids (n = 46) or placebo capsules (n = 46). INTERVENTIONS: Administration of 1350 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 850 mg of docosahexaenoic acid daily or placebo. After 6 months, all patients in addition received subcutaneously 44 mug of interferon beta-1a 3 times per week for another 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was MRI disease activity as measured by the number of new T1-weighted gadolinium-enhancing lesions during the first 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included MRI disease activity after 9 months and 24 months, relapse rate, disability progression, fatigue, quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: The cumulative number of gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions during the first 6 months were similar in the omega-3 fatty acids and placebo groups (median difference, 1; 95% CI, 0 to 3; P = .09). No difference in relapse rate was detected after 6 (median difference, 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0; P = .54) or 24 (median difference, 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0; P = .72) months. The proportion of patients without disability progression was 70% in both groups (P > .99). No differences were detected in fatigue or quality-of-life scores, and no safety concerns appeared. Serum analyses of fatty acids showed an increase in omega-3 fatty acids (mean difference, 7.60; 95% CI, 5.57 to 7.91; P < .001) in the patients treated with omega-3 fatty acids compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSION: No beneficial effects on disease activity were detected from omega-3 fatty acids when compared with placebo as monotherapy or in combination with interferon beta-1a. Magnetic resonance imaging disease activity was reduced as expected by interferon beta-1a. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00360906.",

"Title": "Effects of a pulsed electromagnetic therapy on multiple sclerosis fatigue and quality of life: a double-blind, placebo controlled trial",
"Abstract": "CONTEXT: There is a growing literature on the biological and clinical effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields. Some studies suggest that electromagnetic therapies may be useful in the treatment of chronic illnesses. This study is a follow-up to a placebo controlled pilot study in which multiple sclerosis (MS) patients exposed to weak, extremely low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields showed significant improvements on a composite symptom measure. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a pulsed electromagnetic therapy on MS related fatigue, spasticity, bladder control, and overall quality of life. DESIGN: A multi-site, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial. Each subject received 4 weeks of the active and placebo treatments separated by a 2-week washout period. SETTING: The University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle Wash, the Neurology Center of Fairfax in Fairfax, Va, and the headquarters of the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America in Cherry Hill, NJ. SUBJECTS: 117 patients with clinically definite MS. INTERVENTION: Daily exposure to a small, portable pulsing electromagnetic field generator. MAIN OUTCOME: The MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) was used to assess changes in fatigue, bladder control, spasticity, and a quality of life composite. RESULTS: Paired t-tests were used to assess treatment differences in the 117 subjects (81% of the initial sample) who completed both treatment sessions. Improvements in fatigue and overall quality of life were significantly greater on the active device. There were no treatment effects for bladder control and a disability composite, and mixed results for spasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this randomized, double-bind, placebo controlled trial is consistent with results from smaller studies suggesting that exposure to pulsing, weak electromagnetic fields can alleviate symptoms of MS. The clinical effects were small, however, and need to be replicated. Additional research is also needed to examine the possibility that ambulatory patients and patients taking interferons for their MS may be most responsive to this kind of treatment.",

"Title": "A randomised placebo controlled exploratory study of vitamin B-12, lofepramine, and L-phenylalanine (the \"Cari Loder regime\") in the treatment of multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether combination therapy with lofepramine, L-phenylalanine, and intramuscular vitamin B-12 (the \"Cari Loder regime\") reduces disability in patients with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A placebo controlled, double blind, randomised study carried out in five United Kingdom centres on outpatients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis, measurable disability on Guy's neurological disability scale (GNDS), no relapse in the preceding six months, and not on antidepressant drugs. Over 24 weeks all patients received vitamin B-12, 1 mg intramuscularly weekly, and either lofepramine 70 mg and L-phenylalanine 500 mg twice daily, or matching placebo tablets. Outcome was assessed using the GNDS, the Kurtzke expanded disability status scale; the Beck depression inventory, the Chalder fatigue scale, and the Gulick MS specific symptom scale. RESULTS: 138 patients were entered, and two were lost from each group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at entry or at follow up. Analysis of covariance suggested that treated patients had better outcomes on four of the five scales used. Both groups showed a reduction of 2 GNDS points within the first two weeks, and when data from all time points were considered, the treated group had a significant improvement of 0.6 GNDS points from two weeks onwards. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with multiple sclerosis improved by 2 GNDS points after starting vitamin B-12 injections. The addition of lofepramine and L-phenylalanine added a further 0.6 points benefit. More research is needed to confirm and explore the significance of this clinically small difference.",

"Title": "A multimodal intervention for patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: feasibility and effect on fatigue",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease influenced by environmental factors. OBJECTIVES: The feasibility of a multimodal intervention and its effect on perceived fatigue in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were assessed. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a single-arm, open-label intervention study in an outpatient setting. INTERVENTIONS: A multimodal intervention including a modified paleolithic diet with supplements, stretching, strengthening exercises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage was used. OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to each component of the intervention was calculated using daily logs. Side-effects were assessed from a monthly questionnaire and blood analyses. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Data were collected at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. RESULTS: Ten (10) of 13 subjects who were enrolled in a 2-week run-in phase were eligible to continue in the 12-month main study. Of those 10 subjects, 8 completed the study and 6 subjects fully adhered to the study intervention for 12 months. Over a 12-month period, average adherence to diet exceeded 90% of days, and to exercise/muscle stimulation exceeded 75% of days. Nutritional supplements intake varied among and within subjects. Group daily average duration of meditation was 13.3 minutes and of massage was 7.2 minutes. No adverse side-effects were reported. Group average FSS scores decreased from 5.7 at baseline to 3.32 (p=0.0008) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this small, uncontrolled pilot study, there was a significant improvement in fatigue in those who completed the study. Given the small sample size and completer rate, further evaluation of this multimodal therapy is warranted.",

"Title": "A Multimodal, Nonpharmacologic Intervention Improves Mood and Cognitive Function in People with Multiple Sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether participation in a 12-month multimodal intervention would improve mood and cognitive function in adults with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: In this one-arm, open-label feasibility trial, participants were prescribed a home-based multimodal intervention, including (1) a modified Paleolithic diet; (2) an exercise program (stretching and strengthening of the trunk and lower limb muscles); (3) neuromuscular electrical stimulation (EStim) of trunk and lower limb muscles; and (4) stress management (meditation and self-massage). Individuals completed measures of mood (Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories) and cognitive (Cognitive Stability Index, Cognitive Screening Test, DelisÃ¢â‚¬â€œKaplan Executive Function System) and executive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12Ã‚Â months after the start of the intervention. Dosage of the multimodal intervention was assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12Ã‚Â months. Results: The more individuals participated in the intervention activities, the greater improvements they had from baseline to 12Ã‚Â months on self-report measures of anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]; ps = 0.001 to 0.02), depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]; ps = <0.0001 to 0.09), cognitive function (Cognitive Stability Index [CSI/T], Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [DKEFS]; ps = 0.001 to 0.06), and executive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS]; ps = <0.0001 to 0.09). Mood and cognitive improvements were more closely related to a higher intake of the modified Paleolithic diet than to exercise and stress management dosage. Anxiety and depression changes were evident after just a few months, whereas changes in cognitive function were generally not observed until later in the intervention period. Mood and cognitive function changes from baseline to 12Ã‚Â months were significantly associated with fatigue improvements (ps = <0.0001 to 0.03). Conclusions: A modified Paleolithic diet, exercise, EStim, and stress management intervention like this one has the potential to improve the mood and cognitive symptoms that can lead to considerable suffering in people with MS, potentially improving quality of life and function for people with progressive MS.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness in Motion is an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention that uses yoga movement, mindfulness meditation, and relaxing music. This study examined the feasibility of using Mindfulness in Motion in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the effect of this program on stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life in people with MS. METHODS: Twenty-two people with MS completed the 8-week mindfulness program as well as assessments 1 week before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Pre/post comparison of four self-reported questionnaires-the Mental Health Inventory, 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-showed significant improvement in physical functioning, vitality, and mental health. Specifically, improvements were seen in anxiety, depression, and positive affect; cognitive, psychosocial, and overall functioning regarding fatigue; and mindfulness in the areas of observing, acting with awareness, nonjudgment, and nonreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the uncertainty in disease progression associated with MS, and the multiplicity of mental and physical symptoms associated with it, programming that addresses anxiety, depression, and fatigue is a key area of future research in MS disease management. Mindfulness in Motion proved to be a feasible program yielding positive results, supporting the need for research to determine the extent to which the program can improve quality-of-life outcomes for people with MS.",

"Title": "The effect of Mediterranean diet and exercise as a complementary therapy in fatigue of patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS)",
"Abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis(MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system that characterised by disabling symptoms of which excessive fatigue is the most frequent. Fatigue is reported as the most invalidating symptom in MS. Various mechanisms directly and indirectly related to the disease and physical inactivity have been reported to contribute to the fatigue. Exercise therapy and change in a regular diet can induce physiological and psychological effects that may counter these mechanisms and reduce fatigue in MS. Methods: 70RRMS patients (age:26-41 years) with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) less than 5.5 were enrolled. Control group (n= 35) received isocaloric Mediterranean diet and intervention group received isocaloric Mediterranean dietary plus an exercise program consist of a stretching exercise program every days and 3 days strengthening program for large muscle groups in upper and lower limbs. The patients visited every three months throughout the study. The usual dietary intake and physical activity was assessed using 3-day food recall and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) respectively. FSS(fatigue severity scale) was evaluated at the first and the end of 6 months after beginning of the study. The adherence to Mediterranean diet and exercise was assessed using Mediterranean dietary score based on FFQ and a log book respectively. The scores of two groups were then compared using statistical tests such as repeated measures ANOVA test. Results: The results indicated significant changes in the intervention group in comparison to the control group in FSS: -6.9, P-value = 0.02, Conclusion: Mediterranean diet plus exercise might have beneficial effects as a complementary therapy in reduction of fatigue in RRMS patients with EDSS< 5.5.",

"Title": "The effects of Pilates-fisios on pain, motor fatigue, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled clinical trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Pain and fatigue are common symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) that patients identify as interfering most with their daily activities. Motor disturbances associated with spasticity are also likely to contribute to the fatigue and pain. According to the recent recommendations, treatment strategies for pain and fatigue management in MS are to progress. There are evidences as to Pilates developing balance, mobility and muscle strength of MS patients but the effects on pain and fatigue are not known. Aims: The goals of this study is to investigate the effect of Pilates- Fisios on pain, motor fatigue, in outpatients with MS and its impact on quality of life. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial study, 20 MS patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 10 patients each. The experimental group began to follow the Pilates-Fisios training for two months in one-hour sessions twice a week for a total of 16 sessions, whereas the control group received an exercise program consisted of Muscle Relaxation Technique, Aerobic and Respiratory Exercises, with the same timing. Both the experimental and control groups were evaluated using a questionnaires for Motor Fatigue with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), for Quality of Life with Functional Assessment Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain before and after the interventions and they were assessed after one month from the end of training. Results: There is significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS) (p=0.001) as well as improvement in quality of life (FAMS) after the Pilates-Fisios training. There are no significant differences into two groups about the impact on Motor Fatigue. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of positive effects on pain intensity and almost all domains of quality of life for patients followed the Pilates-Fisios exercises respect on the other program of control group.",

"Title": "Walking improvement after deep rTMS with H-coil associated with rehabilitation in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis: A randomised, controlled, double-blind study",
"Abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether repeated sessions of transcranial repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with H-coil could enhance the benefit of rehabilitation on walking abilities in patients with spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Background: Impaired walking has a strong impact on disability associated with MS and its treatments options are limited. Preliminary findings showed that repeated sessions of focal repetitive transcranial stimulation improved spasticity associated with MS but no data are aviable on the impact on walking ability. Recently, the development of H-coils has been proved to allow reaching deeper brain regions as compared with focal stimulation. Design/Methods: Twenty-three progressive MS patients with lower limb spasticity, undergoing inpatients rehabilitation, were randomized to receive real (11 pts) or sham (11 pts; one patient refused to partecipate after randomization) 10-min sessions of high-frequency rTMS for 3 weeks following their rehabilitation sessions. Primary outcome was percent change at the 10-meter walk test. Secondary outcomes were: walking endurance (6-min walking test), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Visual Analogue Scale for spasticity, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), EDSS, PASAT and Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Results: At the end of treatment, both groups showed improvement in all outcome parameters, although improvement in walking tests (10-mt-WT and 6-min-WT) was significant in the real rTMS group only. The latter group, when compared with the sham group, had significantly better improvement of the primary outcome (10-mt-WT; p<0.05) and 6-min.WT (p=0,002) and MAS score (p=0.037). No serious adverse effects were reported and no patient discontinued the study due to adverse effects. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that deep brain stimulation with H-Coil increases the effects of rehabilitation in improving walking ability, in terms of both speed and endurance. The treatment is safe and feasible. These encouraging results need to be validated with phase-3 studies.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of functional balance exercises on balance impairment, physical activity and quality of life (QOL) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: A multiple-baseline time-series design with an uncontrolled intervention. METHOD: Ten subjects with MS completed assessments twice before and once after a 10-week balance intervention. ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of testing session on the Brief-BESTest, instrumented stance and gait recordings by inertial motion sensors, lower-limb strength recorded by force transducers, accelerometry-based activity, the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire, the Modified Fatigue Impact scale (MFIS) and the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. RESULTS: The intervention associated with significantly improved scores on the MSQOL-54 mental component, MFIS, MSWS-12 and Brief-BESTest. Sway amplitude significantly decreased and jerk significantly increased during instrumented standing on foam with eyes closed. Instrumented gait recordings of sagittal trunk range of motion also significantly decreased. ABC scores, strength measures and activity measures were not significantly changed. CONCLUSIONS: Ten weeks of functional balance exercises provided a feasible intervention for individuals with MS that improved components of balance, mental well-being and perceived fatigue impact and ambulation disability. A future randomized, controlled clinical trial should confirm these preliminary findings. Implications for Rehabilitation A balance-specific exercise program is both safe and feasible for individuals with mild-to-moderate MS. Comprehensive exercise interventions that are conceptually driven and employ well-designed progressive exercise across multiple contexts of balance control can facilitate improvements in balance impairments associated with MS. Functional balance exercises can positively impact clinical and objective measures of balance control and favorably influence perceptions of ambulation disability and fatigue as well as perceived quality of life in people with MS.",

"Title": "How does exercise influence fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis?",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: This study explored the influence of an 8-week exercise programme on fatigue perceptions in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: Eight women and two men with a confirmed diagnosis of MS participated three times a week in an 8-week exercise programme at a physiotherapy gymnasium. Participants were interviewed at three defined time points. Interviews were transcribed, analysed, and emergent categories were subject to verification by three independent sources. RESULTS: Five interrelated categories were identified from the data. The category, 'listening to your body' evolved from the participants' 'perceived control over fatigue', which subsequently defined the 'reaching the edge'; a critical point at which the 'nature of tiredness' perceived by participants following exercise was either healthy or unhealthy. This critical point consequently explained either perceived positive 'exercise outcomes' outcomes of physical improvement and wellbeing or perceived physical deterioration and negative feelings. CONCLUSION: This study details the positive and negative influences of exercise on fatigue perceptions in people with MS. Healthcare professionals therefore, need to be cognisant of strategies which may enhance 'perceived control over fatigue' and promote 'listening to your body', in order to maximise the benefits of exercise intervention for individuals with MS-related fatigue.",

"Title": "Aerobic exercise improves fitness and cognition in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular fitness, brain function, and novel MRI markers of mitochondrial function. BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise increases hippocampal size and improves memory in older adults. Animal models and cross-sectional MS studies of aerobic exercise show improved recovery from relapses and associations with brain substructure volumes. A possible mechanism of action is improved CNS mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that an aerobic exercise intervention would improve fitness, cognition, and fatigue in people with MS. We interrogated the CNS metabolic state using phosphorous MR spectroscopy (31P MRS) to determine CNS mitochondrial function. DESIGN/METHODS: 11 participants with relapsing MS and no walking limitations used a treadmill at target heart rate for 30 minutes, 4 times per week, for 8 weeks under supervision. Prior to and post-intervention, participants underwent VO2Max testing, 7T 31P MRS of brain and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle during exercise, and phlebotomy. Subjects completed walking tests, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and Symbol Digits Modality Test (SDMT, cognitive processing speed). RESULTS: 10 subjects (9 female, age 44.7+/-9.4 years) completed the protocol. One subject was terminated early for recurrent exercise-induced syncope. Mean disease duration was 14.6 +/-6.5 years, and median EDSS was 3.5 (2.5 -4.0). Resting heart rate, fat mass, and lean mass improved significantly (all p<0.05), as did systolic BP among pre-hypertensive participants (n=4). Significant improvements in SDMT (+7 points, 15[percnt], p <0.05) and the cognitive component of the MFIS (-3.8 points, 26[percnt], p<0.05) were observed. The phosphocreatine recovery constant of the TA muscle improved significantly (27.9[percnt], p<0.05). Brain 31P MRS results and laboratory analyses of serum inflammatory markers will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise improved cardiovascular fitness and cognition in a brief intervention. Aerobic exercise should be considered for cognitive rehabilitation programs.",

"Title": "Effects of Pilates exercises on sensory interaction, postural control and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decreased postural control, sensory integration deficits and fatigue are important problems that cause functional impairments in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). PURPOSE: To examine the effect of modified clinical Pilates exercises on sensory interaction and balance, postural control and fatigue in pwMS. METHODS: Eleven patients with multiple sclerosis and 12 healthy matched controls were recruited in this study. Limits of stability and postural stability tests were used to evaluate postural control by Biodex Balance System and sensory interaction assessed. Fatigue was assessed by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. Pilates exercises were applied two times a week for 10 weeks and measurements were repeated to pwMS after exercise training. RESULTS: Postural control and fatigue (except psychosocial parameter) of pwMS were significantly worser than healthy controls (p<0.05). Significant improvements occurred in sensory interaction (eyes open, foam surface) and total, physical and cognitive scores of fatigue after 10-week modified clinical Pilates training (p<0.05). No significant changes were detected in postural control after the pilates exercises (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ten-week Pilates training is effective to improve sensory interaction and to decrease fatigue. Pilates exercises can be applied safely in ambulatory pwMS for enhance sensory interaction and balance and combat fatigue. More investigations are needed. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Title": "Effect of resistance training on risk of coronary artery disease in women with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "The effects of a lower-extremity progressive resistance-training program (PRT) on risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) were determined in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Twelve ambulatory women with MS (47.3+/-4.7 years; Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), 4.00+/-1.37) completed twice weekly lower-body PRT for 8 weeks. Knee extensor and ankle flexor strength improved significantly (p<0.05) after training, and self-reported fatigue decreased (p<0.05). Serum triglyceride concentrations decreased (p<0.05) but body-weight and fatness, blood pressure, and serum glucose, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unchanged. However, the number of CAD risk factors that reached the clinical threshold for each subject declined after PRT, suggesting that resistance training can promote CAD risk reduction in ambulatory female MS subjects.",

"Title": "Impact of a 10-week individualized exercise program on physical function and fatigue of people with multiple sclerosis: a pilot study",
"Abstract": "Research has found that people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who engage in exercise programs experience improvements in physical and psychological health, resulting in enhanced quality of life. These studies have involved structured exercise protocols, but few have examined the effects of an individualized exercise program allowing for peer socialization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 10-week individualized exercise program offering opportunities to socialize with peers on fatigue and physical functioning in people with MS. Thirteen individuals with a physician diagnosis of MS were enrolled in a 10-week exercise program at Nazareth College in Rochester, New York. Eleven participants (9 female, 2 male; mean Ã‚Â± SD age, 55.0 Ã‚Â± 7.06 years) completed the study. The following qualitative and quantitative measures were used for evaluation before and after the exercise program: Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54), Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Timed 10-Meter Walk (T10MW) test, functional reach test, and single-leg stance (SLS) test. Statistically significant differences were found for the TUG (P = .005), T10MW (P = .014), and MFIS physical functioning subscore (P = .039). The results showed significant increases in gait speed and mobility as well as decreased impact of fatigue on physical functioning after the 10-week exercise program.",

"Title": "Physical exercise in multiple sclerosis-related fatigue: Changes in gene expression profile",
"Abstract": "Background and purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) related fatigue is a challenging symptom with unknown etiology. Physical exercise is a treatment option. Exercise modifies the gene expression profile in other conditions different from MS. We here aimed to explore the effect of the physical exercise, on the gene expression profile, in a sample of MS patients with fatigue who satisfactorily responded to the training. Methods: Prospective and longitudinal study. Fourteen MS patients and 15 age matched healthy voluntaries (HV) participated in the study. We included relapsing remitting MS, age 18-50 and clinical and treatment stability for the last 3 months. Patients followed a six month aerobic physical exercise program. Fatigue was assessed, using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale at baseline and at month sixth. Blood samples were collected at the same time points from patients and HV. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples using the PAXgene blood RNA system. All microarrays were subjected to quality and filtering criteria. These were assessed on Principal Component AnalysisPlots and Boxwhisker Plot. Mann Whitney test was used to identify genes differentially expressed between groups at the level of significance p < 0.05 with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing corrections. After obtaining the different gene profiles we used Ingenuity pathway analysis 8.5 (IPA) in order to indentify the functions and pathways related with this genes. Results: RNA samples from four patients did not fulfill the quality criteria, and were excluded from the study. Ten MS patients and 15 HV were finally included. Seven patients (70%) improved their fatigue status after the exercise program, and these were considered for the gene analysis. Comparison between MS and HV at baseline showed 1018 genes differentially expressed (653 over expressed and 358 under expressed in the MS group). After the exercise program the genetic profile changed in the MS group, with only 360 genes differentially expressed compared to HV. This would suggest that exercise could favor a normalization of the gene profile in patients. Fifty five intracellular signaling pathways were identified to be related with the genes expressed. Conclusion: Physical exercise modulates the molecular hallmark in those MS patients who improve their fatigue status. This finding could explain some of the mechanisms involved in the symptom.",

"Title": "Feasibility and Impact of an 8-Week Integrative Yoga Program in People with Moderate Multiple Sclerosis-Related Disability: A Pilot Study",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This pilot study determined the feasibility of a specifically designed 8-week yoga program for people with moderate multiple sclerosis (MS)-related disability. We explored the program's effect on quality of life (QOL) and physical and mental performance. METHODS: We used a single-group design with repeated measurements at baseline, postintervention, and 8-week follow-up. Feasibility was examined through cost, recruitment, retention, attendance, and safety. Outcomes included the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI), 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), Timed 25-Foot Walk test (T25FW), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Five-Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSTS), Multidirectional Reach Test (MDRT), maximum expiratory pressure, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3? (PASAT-3?). RESULTS: Fourteen participants completed the study. The program was feasible. There were significant main effects on the 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey Mental Component Summary (SF-36 MCS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Bladder Control Scale (BLCS), Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ), Mental Health Inventory (MHI), MSWS-12, T25FW, NHPT, PASAT-3?, 6MWT, FTSTS, and MDRT-Back. Improvements were found on the SF-36 MCS, MFIS, BLCS, PDQ, MHI, and MSWS-12 between baseline and postintervention. The effect on PDQ persisted at follow-up. Improvements were found on the T25FW, NHPT, 6MWT, FTSTS, and MDRT-Back between baseline and postintervention that persisted at follow-up. The PASAT-3? did not change between baseline and postintervention but did between postintervention and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The yoga program was safe and feasible. Improvements in certain measures of QOL and performance were seen at postintervention and follow-up.",

"Title": "Combination of aerobic and resistant training in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of an 8-week rehabilitation programme consisting of the aerobic and resistant training forms on the parameters of functional fitness, muscle strength, cardiovascular autonomic functions, fatigue, and functional independence in a group of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). At the beginning and at the end of the study we examined 15 MS patients with a clinically active form of MS (age 50.7 Ã‚Â± 13.1 years, 12 women, 3 men, mean duration of MS 15.4 Ã‚Â± 14.4 years, EDSS 2.8 Ã‚Â± 0.7), who participated in the rehabilitation programme. The diagnosis was made at the 1st Dept. of Neurology. The patients underwent a clinical examination, MS activity rating (EDSS), symptom-limited bicycle spiroergometry (MedGraphics), spectral analysis of heart rate variability by a Task Force Monitor (frequency band LF, HF, TP, and sympathovagal balance LF/HF), and an extremity muscle strength evaluation (1-RM). The patients were also tested for fatigue (MFIS questionnaire) and functional independence (FIM). The outpatient RHB programme controlled was designed for 8 weeks with a frequency of twice a week. The training unit lasted for 60 to 90 minutes and consisted of a warm-up phase (10 min), an aerobic phase (1st to 2nd week 20-40 min; 3rd to 8th week 25 min), and a relaxation phase (10 min). Resistant training was added to the training unit in the 3rd week of the RHB programme (3rd to 8th week 15-20 min). ECG, blood pressure, and RPE were monitored during the aerobic phase for safety reasons. Three exercises were performed: bench press, pulldown, and leg extension. The intensity of resistant training was determined by the 1-RM method. The patients started resistance exercises at 30-60 % 1-RM with a weekly increase of 10 %. All three exercises were repeated 10 times in 3 to 5 sets. A comparison of the entrance and final values showed a significant improvement of functional capacity, namely in the values of spiroergometry parameters (P<0.05, Wilcoxon paired test) W(SL) (94.4 Ã‚Â± 25.0 vs. 102.7 Ã‚Â± 27.9 W, p = 0.042), W(SL). kg(-1) (1.4 Ã‚Â± 0.3 vs.1.5 Ã‚Â± 0.4 W.kg(-1), p = 0.026), Vo(2SL) (1463.1 Ã‚Â± 359.2 vs. 1578.4 Ã‚Â± 390.3 mlO(2), p = 0.015), and also in the values of muscle strength in bench press (22.3 Ã‚Â± 9.3 vs. 28.1 Ã‚Â± 9.7 kg, p = 0.0001), pulldown (22.1 Ã‚Â± 11.3 vs. 28.3 Ã‚Â± 11.3 kg, p = 0.0001), and leg extension (26.5 Ã‚Â± 8.3 vs. 30.9 Ã‚Â± 9.0 kg, p = 0.001). We detected a positive significant impact of the rehabilitation programme on the MFIS self-perception fatigue scale (28.5 Ã‚Â± 17.6 vs. 26.0 Ã‚Â± 14.9, p = 0.018; MFISp 14.6 Ã‚Â± 8.3 vs. 13.3 Ã‚Â± 6.9, p = 0.043). The other parameters under study did not achieve statistical relevance. We consider the increase in HRV spectral powers as a sign of improving adaptability of autonomic cardiovascular regulation. The clinical status (EDSS) and functional independence (FIM) were not influenced by the exercise training load and the length of the rehabilitation programme. We can conclude that the results of our study demonstrate a possibility of influencing some of the physical fitness parameters, muscle strength, and self-perceived fatigue after 8 weeks of the rehabilitation programme realised twice a week with a combination of the aerobic and resistant training forms in a group of MS patients with mild to moderate clinical disability (EDSS 2.8 Ã‚Â± 0.7).",

"Title": "Can aerobic treadmill training reduce the effort of walking and fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis: a pilot study",
"Abstract": "Impaired mobility in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with high-energy costs and effort when walking, gait abnormalities, poor endurance and fatigue. This repeated measures trial with blinded assessments investigated the effect of treadmill walking at an aerobic training intensity in 16 adults with MS. The intervention consisted of 12 sessions of up to 30 minutes treadmill training (TT), at 55-85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. The primary outcome measure was walking effort, measured by oxygen consumption (mL/kg per metre), during treadmill walking at comfortable walking speed (CWS). Associated changes in gait parameters using the 'Gait-Rite' mat, 10-m time and 2-minute distance, and Fatigue Severity Scale were examined. Following training, oxygen consumption decreased at rest (P = 0.008), CWS increased (P = 0.002), and 10-m times (P = 0.032) and walking endurance (P = 0.020) increased. At increased CWS, oxygen consumption decreased (P = 0.020), with a decreased time spent in stance in the weaker leg (P = 0.034), and a greater stride distance with the stronger leg (P = 0.044). Reported fatigue levels remained the same. Aerobic TT presents the opportunity to alter a motor skill and reduce the effort of walking, whilst addressing cardiovascular de-conditioning, thereby, potentially reducing effort and fatigue for some people with MS.",

"Title": "High-intensity resistance training in multiple sclerosis - An exploratory study of effects on immune markers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and on mood, fatigue, health-related quality of life, muscle strength, walking and cognition",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-intensity resistance training is unexplored in people with multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effects of high-intensity resistance training on immune markers and on measures of mood, fatigue, health-related quality of life, muscle strength, walking and cognition. Further, to describe participants' opinion and perceived changes of the training. METHODS: Twenty patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis performed high-intensity resistance training at an intensity of 80% of one-repetition maximum, twice a week for 12 weeks. Blood and optional cerebrospinal fluid samples, and data on secondary outcome measures were collected before and after intervention. A study-specific questionnaire was used for capturing participants' opinion. RESULTS: Seventeen participants completed the study. Plasma cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor were significantly decreased post-intervention (p=0.001). Exploratory cytokine analyses in cerebrospinal fluid (n=8) did not reveal major changes. Significant and clinically important improvements were found in fatigue (p=0.001) and health-related quality of life (p=0.004). Measures of mood (p=0.002), muscle strength (p <= 0.001), walking speed (p=0.013) and cognition (p=0.04) were also improved. A majority of participants evaluated the training as very good and perceived changes to the better. CONCLUSION: High-intensity resistance training in persons with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis with low disability had positive effects on peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, led to clinically relevant improvements in measures of fatigue and health-related quality of life, and was well tolerated. These results provide a basis for a larger randomized trial. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a short-duration, combined (inspiratory and expiratory), progressive resistance respiratory muscle training (RMT) protocol on respiratory muscle strength, fatigue, health-related quality of life, and functional performance in individuals with mild-to-moderate multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Quasi-experimental before-after trial. SETTING: University rehabilitation research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers with MS (N=21) were divided into 2 groups: RMT (n=11; 9 women, 2 men; mean age +/- SD, 50.9 +/- 5.7y, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score +/- SD, 3.2 +/- 1.9) and a control group that did not train (n=10; 7 women, 3 men; mean age +/- SD, 56.2 +/- 8.8y, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score +/- SD, 4.4 +/- 2.1). Expanded Disability Status Scale scores ranged from 1 to <=6.5. No patients withdrew from the study. INTERVENTION: Training was a 5-week combined progressive resistance RMT program, 3d/wk, 30 minutes per session. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were maximal inspiratory pressure and expiratory pressure and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. All subjects completed secondary measures of pulmonary function, the six-minute walk test, the timed stair climb, the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the Physical Activity Disability Scale. RESULTS: Maximal inspiratory pressure and expiratory pressure (mean +/- SD) increased 35% +/- 22% (P<.001) and 26% +/- 17% (P<.001), respectively, whereas no changes were noted in the control group (12% +/- 23% and -4% +/- 17%, respectively). RMT improved fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, P<.029), with no change or worsening in the control group. No changes were noted in the six-minute walk test, stair climb, Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale, or Physical Activity Disability Scale in the RMT group. The control group had decreases in emotional well-being and general health (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey). CONCLUSIONS: A short-duration, combined RMT program improved inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength and reduced fatigue in patients with mild to moderate MS.

"Abstract": "Objectives: To measure the impact at 2 months of a program of rehabilitation training on bicycle ergometer at home on a fatigue among a population of patients younger than 50 years, who have a relapsing-remitting MS Materials and methods: Multicentre non-randomized pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a program of physical training at home on a bicycle ergometer. Were included the patient with RRMS, complaining of fatigue predominantly on the physical dimension of less than 50 years without cardiovascular indications against a reconditioning program in the effort, with an EDSS <4, without cognitive impairment, or thrust in the last three months. Excluded were patients with locomotor pathology, neurological or cardiovascular not allowing the normal stationary cycling, with no motivation for a program of re-entrainment. The intervention was an educational short (one hour) to the repackaging effort on a cycle ergometer (home delivery) at ventilatory threshold, 25 min per session, 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks The primary endpoint was fatigue 2 (EMIF), secondary endpoints membership qualitative and quantitative, walking speed (7.5 m test) and endurance (6 min test), quality of life (SF-36). The number of subjects required was 30. Results: Achieving a autoprogramme home exercise on bicycle ergometer by 25 patients, allowed a significant improvement of fatigue on the total EMIF, walking speed and endurance, without significant effect on the quality of life . Discussion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of a good home reentrainment cycle ergometer with limited supervision. The main limitations are lack of control group, a limited number of subjects, a low EDSS. The effect on the continuation of a longterm physical activity is unknown in the absence of monitoring.",

"Abstract": "Fatigue, reduced quality of life (QOL), and lower physical activity levels are commonly reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the effects of elliptical exercise on fatigue and QOL reports in patients with MS. Patients with MS (n = 26) completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) before and after completing 15 elliptical exercise training sessions. Changes in fatigue and QOL were assessed based on any changes in the fatigue and SF-36 questionnaires, and correlations between changes in each of the scales were made to determine whether a relationship was present between the fatigue and QOL measures. Results showed significant improvement in FSS, MFIS, and five SF-36 subscales as a result of elliptical exercise. The change in FSS correlated with change in two of the SF-36 subscales. Elliptical exercise for patients with MS results in significant improvements in both fatigue and QOL. These findings indicate that regular elliptical exercise could be a part of inpatient and outpatient MS rehabilitation programs.",

"Title": "Effects of gait training on brain plasticity in multiple sclerosis: A functional MRI study",
"Abstract": "Background: Physiotherapy seems to improve activity and participation in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to promote brain plasticity, but a standardized approach and objective measures of efficacy are lacking. Objectives: To study functional and structural variations of specific areas of the brain induced by intensive gait rehabilitation using advanced MRI techniques. Methods: Twenty-nine ambulatory MS patients were recruited. They underwent an extensive clinical evaluation including scales testing balance, gait function, endurance and fatigue. Brain MRI was performed as well, including motor task functional MRI (fMRI) (plantar dorsiflexion of the feet), resting state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging. The clinical and MRI assessments were performed at T0 (before starting physiotherapy), T1 (at the end) and T2 (3 months after the end of the rehabilitation period). Results: Twenty-six patients completed the T0 and T1 evaluations, sixteen completed all the time-points. The static and dynamic balance significantly improved after neuromotor rehabilitation, as did measures of fatigue, physical endurance and functioning. This improvement was not fully maintained at T2. As regard MRI data, no changes in cortical thickness and diffusion parameters were observed between T0 and T1, although a trend towards an increase in fractional anistropy was found in both left and right cingulum (p=0.061and 0.067). Resting state fMRI showed that rehabilitation is associated with an increase of functional connectivity (puncorr = 0.004) both in pre-central and post-central gyrus. With motor task fMRI, at the baseline patients showed a diffuse activation involving motor and somatosensory areas of both hemispheres. At T1, most patients showed a more focal activation involving motor areas, although the difference did not reach statistical significance, with the exception of the reduction in the activation of the contralateral precentral gyrus in the left foot motor task. Conclusions: Our findings suggest an immediate positive effect of intensive gait rehabilitation on a clinical ground, with the improvement of several parameters related to endurance, balance, physical functioning and fatigue. fMRI data support the notion that, even in a disabling MS stage, physiotherapy might have an impact on brain plasticity leading to a reorganization of the sensorimotor network.",

"Title": "Effects of an intensive, multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation program in subjects with multiple sclerosis with different levels of disability: Preliminary data",
"Abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease leading to progressive disability among young adults. Motor rehabilitation strategies proposed for MS patients are heterogeneous; moreover, the optimal duration and intensity of treatment are not yet standardized. Objective: To investigate the effects of a tailored, intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MR) on disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in MS patients with different levels of disability. Methods: 30 MS patients [14 males, 16 females, aged 18-65 years; expanded disability status scale (EDSS) = 8.5] were hospitalized in our Department of Brain Injury and Parkinson's Disease Rehabilitation for an inpatient MR. Rehabilitation protocol (3 hours/day, 6 days/week) included front-to-front physiotherapy, mechanical rehabilitative devices, robotic devices (Lokomat, Hocoma) and occupational therapy; it was individually designed for each patient according to the clinical features and severity of disability. Before and after the intervention, participants were evaluated with: EDSS, functional motor tests [Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Trunk Control Test (TCT) for all patients; Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) only for ambulating patients], self-assessed measurement of disability (12-items MS walking scale, 12MSWS), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MFIS) and HRQoL (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life, MSQoL-54). Results: all participants completed the rehabilitation protocol. Mean MR duration was 54.8Ã‚Â±33.7 days. At the end of rehabilitation period, an improvement of both the self-assessed and functional motor scales was recorded (p<0.05 for EDSS, FIM, TCT, DGI, 12MSWS respect to baseline). A positive effect was also observed in self-perception of global health status and fatigue after treatment (p<0.05 for MSQoL-54 and MFIS). Conclusions: we suggest that an intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol is feasible in MS patients with variable levels of disability and effective in improving their motor abilities and quality of life. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longterm treatment effect over time.",

"Title": "The effect of rehabilitation on the perceived level of fatigue of patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Fatigue is one of the three major symptoms affecting about 70-90% of multiple sclerosis patients (MS, ICD-10 G35), and a predominant symptom in nearly 50% of the patients. Fatigue is defined as a subjective feeling of lack of energy to start and continue an activity, which is not related to depression, or muscle weakening. There are similarities and differences between the fatigue experienced by healthy individuals, and the fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients. In both instances, fatigue becomes more intense as a result of stress, or physical and mental effort. Fatigue usually subsides after a rest, or a good night's sleep. In MS patients, fatigue can be caused by even light physical, or mental exertion, and it takes longer than normal to go away. Rest, or sleep do not reduce its intensity. Aim of the study: The main objective of the study was to assess the effect of a two-week rehabilitation programme on the perceived level of fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients. Material and methods: The study included 32 patients with clinically confirmed MS who underwent a comprehensive 2-week rehabilitation programme. The study was conducted at the \"Ostoja\" Centre for Multiple Sclerosis Patients in Wola Batorska from 15 July to 13 October 2013. It was based on a self-designed questionnaire which contained the basic patient data (age, sex), information on duration of the disease, type of MS the patient had been diagnosed with, as well as the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale, and the Fatigue Severity Scale. The respondents were assessed twice: on the first and last day of their stay in the Centre. The statistical analysis was carried out using the STATISTICA 10.0 software. Results: The analysis revealed a statistically highly significant dependence between the two-week rehabilitation programme and the perceived level of fatigue. This means that the perceived level of fatigue in MS patients was significantly reduced as a result of the rehabilitation programme used. Conclusions: After the two-week rehabilitation programme, the perceived level of fatigue in MS patients significantly decreased. The two-week rehabilitation programme significantly reduced the number of patients suffering from chronic fatigue symptoms as assessed on the Fatigue Severity Scale.",

"Title": "Symptom change with exercise is a temporary phenomenon for people with multiple sclerosis.[Erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2006 Sep;87(9):1286]",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a single exercise session on function, fatigue, and sensory symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: This pilot study was designed as a before-after trial. Demographic and response-to-exercise measures were taken before exercise, repeated immediately after exercise, and followed up again 24 hours later. SETTING: Three metropolitan centers of an MS society. PARTICIPANTS: A prospective sample of 34 subjects with MS who were referred for physiotherapy for an exercise program and who could attend an MS society center. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects performed an individually prescribed exercise session, which was at a commencement level and included strengthening, stretches, and fitness exercises. Subjects exercised for between 5 to 45 minutes (mean, 17.4 min) at an intensity of 7 to 17 (median, 12) on the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All outcome measures were self-rated by subjects and included the Borg RPE scale, a questionnaire for sensory symptom description, and visual analog scales for rating of fatigue, function, and intensity of sensory symptoms. RESULTS: Subjective levels of fatigue and function immediately postexercise and 24 hours postexercise did not differ significantly from pre-exercise levels. However, over 40% of subjects experienced a temporary increase in number of sensory symptoms, 44% experienced an increase in the intensity of sensory symptoms, and 29% experienced an increase in both number and intensity immediately postexercise. CONCLUSIONS: This small study found that when people with MS undertake exercise at a commencement level, they can expect that sensory symptoms may change temporarily, but they are unlikely to have any deleterious changes in fatigue and function.",

"Abstract": "Objectives: To determine the effects of home-based exercise program (HEP) on aspects of disability, quality of life (QoL), fatigue and balance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Method: 40 MS patients were enrolled in the study. Demographic, socioeconomic and medical statuses were recorded. Disability [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)], functional balance [Berg Balance Scale (BBS)], perceived level of balance confidence in everyday tasks [Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale)], fatigue [Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)], and QoL [Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) questionnaire] were assessed at baseline and 3 months later. All participants received standardized 12-weeks HEP from an experienced physiotherapist. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in EDSS scores before and after treatment (p=0.41). All patients showed significant improvement in BBS, ABC scale, and MusiQoL scores (p<0.001), and in the cognitive, physical and social components of FIS from baseline to three months (p=0.002, p=0.001, p=0.002, respectively). A statistically significant difference was not found in FIS-total scores (p=0.060). A positive significant correlation was found between MusiQoL and FIStotal scores (p<0.001), cognitive (p=0.004), physical and social (p<0.001) subscores; as well as negative correlation between QoL and ABC scale scores (p<0.001). Discussion: Home-based exercise program resulted in improvements in QoL, fatigue and balance functions in MS individuals. Therefore, neurological rehabilitation professionals, who are specialized on this area, have to consider the benefits of exercise and physical activity for MS patients and encourage them to take part in an exercise program.

"Title": "Efficacy of cycle ergometer rehabilitation treatments in ambulatory multiple sclerosis subjects: A pilot study",
"Abstract": "Objectives: People with MS tend to be less physically active than general population even when their MS has caused minimal disability. One of the most frequently reported symptoms is primary fatigue. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that aerobic exercise training can improve fatigue and endurance in Multiple Sclerosis subjects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of cycle ergometer aerobic training in a group of Multiple Sclerosis subjects. Materials and methods: We recruited 57 MS subjects among those followed as outpatients at AISM Rehabilitation Centre, Italian Multiple Sclerosis Society, Genova, Italy. All subjects were ambulatory and they were trained on a cycle ergometer (TheraVital - Medica - Germany) with anti - spasm control and visual feedback. All subjects were evaluated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Ambulation Index, Timw-to-walk 7,5 meter at the start and at the end of treatment. All subjects were treated for 20 sessions, 2-3 times / week, 45 minutes / session. Results: Out of 57 MS subjects, 38 were female and 19 male; mean age was 54 years, mean EDSS 5,26; Primary Progressive 10,3%, Relapsing remitting 48,3%, Secondary progressive 41,4%. Data analysis showed an improvement for MFIS total Score and Time to walk 7,5 meter with a p < 0,05 while Ambulation Index Score did not showed any improvement. Conclusions: Our data, consistently with previous studies on aerobic exercises in Multiple Sclerosis subjects, underlined the efficacy of rehabilitation treatment with cycle-ergometer in improving fatigue in PwMS. Furthermore the absence of drop outs during the training program showed that MS subjects can safely conduct a cycle-ergometer aerobic training and could be considered as a part of multimodal approach in treating fatigue in MS subjects.",

"Title": "Effects of inpatient rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis patients with moderate disability",
"Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3 weeks of inpatient neurorehabilitation for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with moderate disability and to determine the clinical usefulness of different outcome measures. Rehabilitation consisted of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and consultation by speech therapist, social worker and psychologist. Subjects were assessed in two cohorts. Cohort A (n = 40) was assessed on admission and discharge during a rehabilitation period. Cohort B (n = 18) was assessed 3 weeks before admission, on admission and at discharge. Mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 5.7 Ã‚Â± 0.7 at admission for both cohorts combined. Different motor functions, personal care ability and quality of life were assessed. Improvements (p<0.05) were seen in the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) domains mental health, general health and vitality/fatigue of SF-36. Improvements (p < 0.05) in physical measures such as mobility and standing balance in cohort A, walking speed in cohort B and hand/arm dexterity both cohorts were found. No significant changes were seen in grip strength, personal care ability or fatigue in any cohort. The Barthel Index of ADL seems to have a ceiling effect and the Fatigue Severity Scale seems to be insensitive. In conclusion, improvements were seen after 3 weeks of inpatient rehabilitation in motor functions, some aspects of HRQoL and disability after 3 weeks of inpatient rehabilitation.",

"Title": "Long-term endurance exercise improves aerobic capacity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: impact of baseline fatigue",
"Abstract": "Little is known about the sustainability of exercise effects in patients with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). We present the results of a prospective, observer-blinded, single-center case control study using a \"pre-post\" design including 89 ambulatory patients with RRMS and an EDSS score of <=3.5 who participated in an individualized 12 month aerobic endurance exercise program. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) increased and fatigue levels decreased significantly over time (p=0.03, p<0.02). Subgroup analysis of patients with fatigue (FSS>4) revealed that the increase of VO2 peak remained significant after 12 months whereas patients without fatigue did not improve any further after six months. A significant decrease of the FSS score was only observed after nine months (p<0.03) In conclusion, aerobic exercise leads to a sustainable improvement of VO2 peak over an extended exercise period of 12 months. There is a weak, but significant effect on fatigue levels which becomes detectable only after nine months. Since subgroup analysis revealed that MS patients behaved differently according to their baseline fatigue levels, adjustment to the individual fatigue levels is recommended for future exercise interventions in RRMS patients.

"Title": "Fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients during inpatient rehabilitation",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate symptomatic fatigue in patients with mild to moderate multiple sclerosis (MS) during inpatient rehabilitation. We examined fatigue at the beginning and at the end of a 3-week rehabilitation period as well as its daily variation. METHOD: Ninety-one patients participated. Fatigue severity was measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). On the basis of the FSS scores, patients were divided into a fatigue (n = 66) and non-fatigue (n = 25) group. General fatigue was self-evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale (FVAS). Depression was measured using The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). RESULTS: In the fatigue group the mean FSS score decreased by 0.34 points, whereas in the non-fatigue group it increased by 0.23 points. The difference for change between groups was significant (p = 0.003), but a covariate analysis showed that this was strongly affected by a decrease in depression. Fatigue varied greatly from day-to-day. The lowest FVAS coefficient of variation per patient was 9% and the highest 131%. CONCLUSION: Inpatient rehabilitation decreases MS patients' fatigue. This effect seems to be modified by an improvement in mood.",

"Title": "MSQoL-54 predicts change in fatigue after inpatient rehabilitation for people with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of a short-term inpatient rehabilitation program on fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to assess whether the scales of Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 (MSQoL-54) could predict change in fatigue after rehabilitation. METHOD: Included in the study were 151 moderately disabled MS patients admitted for 3 weeks of inpatient rehabilitation. Fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale; FSS) was assessed at baseline and after treatment, and quality of life (MSQoL-54), disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) were estimated at baseline. RESULTS: Sixty-four percentage of the subjects showed fatigue. Both EDSS (r = 0.720, p = 0.001) and BDI (r = 0.655, p = 0.001) scores showed statistically significant positive correlation with FSS scores. Significant negative correlation was demonstrated between FSS and both, Physical Health Composite (PHC) and Mental Health Composite (MHC) scores of MSQoL-54 (r = -0.770, p = 0.001, and r = -0.646, p = 0.001, respectively). The mean FSS score significantly decreased by 0.19+/-0.29 points in the fatigue group, immediately after rehabilitation. The multiple regression analyses with change of FSS as dependent variable and baseline scores of MSQoL-54 as independent variables showed statistically significant relation between change in fatigue and baseline PHC score (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient rehabilitation decreased MS patients' fatigue. Change in fatigue was predicted with certain domains of QoL at baseline.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the efficacy of outcome measures routinely used in a physical therapy service for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of 500 medical records of MS patients from the outpatients service of AISM Rehabilitation Centre, Genova, Italy. PATIENTS: All records of outpatients followed by AISM Rehabilitation Centre who underwent physical therapy from 2006 to 2008 were evaluated. METHODS: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and Ambulation Index (AI) were reviewed for all records at the begin and at the end of the rehabilitation treatment. RESULTS: The number of assessments recorded was 295 in 209 patients. Out of the 209 patients, 133 were female and 76 were male. The mean age was 51.6 +/- 11.68 years, the mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 4.98 +/- 1.79, and 185 patients were ambulatory. In nonambulatory patients neither scale showed a significant increase. In ambulatory patients (275 assessments) significant changes were observed in AI, MFIS total score and subscores. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy has a positive impact on fatigue, and the MFIS seems to be a good outcome measure in ambulatory patients. The AI and MFIS seem to be not indicated for use in non-ambulatory patients.",

"Title": "Time course of strength adaptations following high-intensity resistance training in individuals with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: No evidence exists regarding the time course and clinical relevance of muscle strength improvements following resistance training in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal course and the clinical meaningfulness of the changes in strength induced by high-intensity resistance training and whether these changes impact on muscle endurance to fatigue and functional outcomes. METHODS: PwMS with predominantly unilateral hyposthenia of the ankle dorsiflexors underwent a 6-week isokinetic training of the more affected ankle dorsiflexion muscles. Maximal strength was measured at baseline, during the training on a weekly basis, at the end of the intervention (POST) and at the 12-week follow-up. Muscle endurance to fatigue, mobility and walking outcomes were assessed at baseline, POST and follow-up. Reproducibility and responsiveness analyses were performed. RESULTS: Significant gains in muscle strength were already detected after 3 weeks of training with no further improvements in the following weeks. These improvements exceeded the cutoff values for relevant changes and were also positively correlated to improved muscle endurance to fatigue and mobility measures. None of the observed changes in muscle performance and functional outcomes was retained at the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence showed that 3 weeks of high-intensity resistance training induces consistent and meaningful improvements in muscle performance of the ankle dorsiflexors in PwMS. These findings may have practical dose-response and cost-effectiveness implications in the management of MS-induced muscle weakness, potentially enhancing the understanding of the response to training exhibited by PwMS.

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of Pilates and Ai-Chi on balance, functional mobility, muscle strength, the level of perceived balance confidence, fatigue, mood and quality of life in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). BACKGROUND: Although MS patients are often referred to the Pilates and Aquatherapy, the scientific evidences of these methods are not sufficient. DESIGN/METHODS: Twenty-nine ambulatory female patients with MS (Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 0-4) were included to the study. Patients were divided into two groups as Pilates (n=18) and Ai-Chi (n=11). Both groups were instructed to do exercises 2 times/week for eight weeks. Static standing balance was measured with single leg balance test, functional mobility was measured with Timed-Up and Go test, upper (shoulder flexion-abduction, elbow flexion), lower extremity (hip flexion-abduction-adduction-extension, knee extension, dorsal flexion) muscle strength were assessed with hand-held dynamometer , the level of perceived balance confidence was evaluated with Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale, fatigue was evaluated with Fatigue Severity Scale, mood was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory, health related quality of life was evaluated using Nottingham Health Profile. RESULTS: Static standing balance, functional mobility and mood were significantly improved in each group (p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly decreased in both groups (p<0.05). Whereas all of upper and lower extremity muscle strengths, the level of perceived balance confidence and quality of life were improved in Pilates group (p<0.05); no significant improvement were found (p>0.05) in Ai-Chi group on elbow flexion, hip adduction and dorsal flexion muscle strength, the level of perceived balance confidence and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: According to these findings, each of two exercise approaches may improve balance, functional mobility and mood but Pilates seems to a better method than Ai-Chi for improving muscle strength, the level of perceived balance confidence and quality of life in patients with MS.",

"Title": "Comparing routine neurorehabilitation programme with callisthenic exercises in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "We conducted a study that examined the effectiveness of callisthenic exercises in multiple sclerosis. 30 individuals were divided into two groups. The first group did 15 callisthenic exercises and the second group did routine neurorehabilitation programme. Both groups did the programmes for three days per week over six weeks. Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F), muscle strength tests, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), Turkish versions of Short Form of 36 (SF-36), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) were used for evaluation. After physiotherapy programmes VAS-F, muscle strength, BBS scores decreased significantly in both groups. HAD anxiety score of the first group and HAD depression score of the second group changed significantly. There were no differences in MSFC and SF-36 scores in any groups. The difference between groups was not significant in any parameters, except for the muscle test for upper limbs of the second group. Callisthenic exercises are seen as a new therapy choice, which are different from routine exercises, in order to decrease fatigue, improve balance and muscle strength. Callisthenics are thought to be a beneficial tool for MS patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

"Abstract": "BACKROUND: The aim of our study is to examine effects of aerobic and Pilates exercises on disability, cognition, physical performance, balance, depression and fatigue in relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as compared to healthy controls. METHODS: The subjects were divided as aerobic exercise (n = 26), Pilates (n = 9), and the healthy control group (n = 21). We used MSFC, physical performance, Berg balance scale, Beck depression scale, fatigue impact scale. All evaluations were performed before and after exercise training. RESULTS: There are statistically meaningful differences between Nine hole testing, PASAT 3, physical performance and fatique impact scale before and after aerobic exercise. Also we found significant difference for physical performance in the Pilates group. There are no significant differences in measures of fatique impact scale and depression between aerobic exercise group and the healthy controls after exercise. We found significant differences between Pilates and control group's after measurements except depression. There were significant differences between the Pilates and aerobic group for cognitive tests in favor of the Pilates group. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise and clinical Pilates exercises revealed moderate changes in levels of cognitive, physical performance, balance, depression, fatigue in MS patients.",

"Title": "The effects of aerobic training on the functional status, quality of life, the level of fatigue and disability in patients with multiple sclerosis-a preliminary report",
"Abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this paper was to assess the effects of aerobic training on the quality of life and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. Material and methods: A total of 53 patients with known multiple sclerosis (ICD G35.0) who began a standard 4-week rehabilitation programme were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: AT (aerobic training) patients (n = 21), who additionally underwent training on a lower limb cycle ergometer (three 10-minute sessions per day with an hour interval), and non-AT group of patients (n = 32). Life quality assessment based on the WHOQOL-BREF scale (World Health Organization Quality of Life), an assessment of motor impairment based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale by Kurtzke (EDSS) and an assessment of the severity of fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were performed at baseline and after four weeks. Results: After completing rehabilitation programmes, an improvement in the quality of life was observed both in AT and non-AT group. However, a more significant improvement in the two evaluated aspects, physical (p = 0.001 vs. 0.01) and psychological (p = 0.001 vs. 0.05), was observed in the AT group. However, no improvement in social terms was observed. There was also a reduction in the severity of fatigue (0.03 for AT group vs. 0.15 for non-AT group). There was no statistically significant improvement in the EDSS score in any of the groups. Conclusions: Aerobic training has beneficial effects on the quality of life and the severity of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.",

"Abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis disorders poses heavy physical and emotional effect on patients who are associated with the disease. Aim: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of individual versus group exercises on fatigue on patients with multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 85 patients with multiple sclerosis were divided in two groups of individualized exercise and team exercise. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks and comprised of mild stretching and basic yoga exercises twice a day. The data were collected through demographic questionnaire, standard fatigue scale and self-reported checklist. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software. Results: The mean levels of fatigue perception after the intervention in group exercise was 27.9 Ã‚Â± 15.9 and 27.1 Ã‚Â± 17.2 in individual exercise. There was no signifi cant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Statistically signifi cant difference was observed in the mean level of perceived fatigue in triplicate measurements (P = 0.013) among patients who completed individual exercise. However, this difference was not signifi cant in the group exercise. Conclusion: Performing mild stretching exercises and basic yoga are recommended as a cost-effective method which is easy to perform among patients with mild to moderate disabilities.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by fatigue, motor weakness, and spasticity, to name a few. MS symptoms may lead to physical inactivity associated with the development of secondary diseases. This study was to investigate the effect of regular aerobic and yoga on the quality of life of patients with MS. METHODS: The present quasi-experimental study was conducted on 90 patients with chronic MS chosen randomly and divided into two test and one control groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 11.5) through paired t-test, ANOVA, and Tukey's post hoc. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the scores of quality of life in the three groups prior to investigation. Although they were significant after intervention. The mean score of yoga group was higher than that of aerobic group, and aerobic group showed a higher mean score compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Yoga and aerobic exercises may improve quality of life in patients with MS. It is highly recommended that the governor along with MS societies and other organizations servicing and supporting patients start to develop sport-regulated programs to help improve quality of life for these patients.",

"Title": "The effect of yoga in people with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) affect patients' physical, cognitive and emotional domains. Current empirical research has provided evidences about the positive effect of yoga among people with MS (PwMS) (e.g. decreased pain, reduced depression and fatigue, improved muscle strength flexibility and relaxation, lower levels of stress, improved QoL). Most of studies evaluated the effects after a long period of treatment (from 12 to 24 weeks; 2/3 sessions a week). Thus, up to now the effects of yoga on a shorter treatment duration are unknown. In this study we evaluated the effects of a short-period treatment of yoga (at least 15 sessions in 6 weeks, 5 sessions each 2 weeks) on these domains. We enrolled 20 Italian PwMS according to inclusion criteria (EDSS<5; no comorbidities; age 18-65 years). The experimental group (EXP, 10 subjects) performed yoga exercises whereas control group (CTRL, 10 subjects) performed no exercise (or other rehabilitative treatments) during the same period of 6 weeks. Groups did not differ for age (EXP, 44.80Ã‚Â±15.10y; CTRL, 48.00Ã‚Â±14.03y), disease duration (EXP, 10.00Ã‚Â±9.33y; CTRL, 12.50Ã‚Â±7.21y), EDSS (EXP, 2.85Ã‚Â±1.68y; CTRL, 2.95Ã‚Â±1.48y) and disease course (both groups of 8 relapsing-remitting and 2 secondary progressive). RM-ANOVA showed that all the outcome measures were not significantly different at the baseline between groups, whereas they were found significantly different (p<0.05) immediately after the last session of yoga. In fact, EXP group improved 2MWT, MFIS, MSIS-29, SDMT, HADS and Life Satisfaction Index. By confirming previous findings, results showed yoga improves physical, cognitive and emotional status of PwMS; interestingly, the effect is present already after a short-period of treatment. However, to draw more useful conclusions about the potential use and benefits of yoga in managing the symptoms of MS, future research should include more rigorously designed trials.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether neurorehabilitation is able to influence clinical parameters and brain function measured radiologically. DESIGN: A group of healthy probands was compared with two groups of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, one of which received rehabilitative therapy. SETTING: Outpatient in a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 17 of whom received rehabilitative therapy, and 13 healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: Two months of rehabilitative eclectic therapy based on principles of sensorimotor learning and adaptation. MAIN MEASURES: Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Beck Depression Inventory Score, Barthel Index, Environment Status Scale and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life--54, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS: Patients who underwent neurorehabilitation showed a greater drop in fatigue, depression, impairment, disability and handicap and more improvement in quality of life than those who did not receive therapy. Correlation of brain activity between the right and the left hemisphere is greater in healthy individuals than in MS patients. Neurorehabilitation resulted in a trend for increased correlation between the left and the right hemisphere in patients (approaching the standard). In comparison with control groups, signal amplitudes in anatomical areas did not show any significant changes. CONCLUSION: Clinical changes seen with neurorehabilitation were not associated with any detectable changes in fMRI observations.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of Pilates and Ai-Chi on balance, functional mobility, muscle strength, the level of perceived balance confidence, fatigue, mood and quality of life in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). BACKGROUND: Although MS patients are often referred to the Pilates and Aquatherapy, the scientific evidences of these methods are not sufficient. DESIGN/METHODS: Twenty-nine ambulatory female patients with MS (Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 0-4) were included to the study. Patients were divided into two groups as Pilates (n=18) and Ai-Chi (n=11). Both groups were instructed to do exercises 2 times/week for eight weeks. Static standing balance was measured with single leg balance test, functional mobility was measured with Timed-Up and Go test, upper (shoulder flexion-abduction, elbow flexion), lower extremity (hip flexion-abduction-adduction-extension, knee extension, dorsal flexion) muscle strength were assessed with hand-held dynamometer , the level of perceived balance confidence was evaluated with Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale, fatigue was evaluated with Fatigue Severity Scale, mood was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory, health related quality of life was evaluated using Nottingham Health Profile. RESULTS: Static standing balance, functional mobility and mood were significantly improved in each group (p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly decreased in both groups (p<0.05). Whereas all of upper and lower extremity muscle strengths, the level of perceived balance confidence and quality of life were improved in Pilates group (p<0.05); no significant improvement were found (p>0.05) in Ai-Chi group on elbow flexion, hip adduction and dorsal flexion muscle strength, the level of perceived balance confidence and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: According to these findings, each of two exercise approaches may improve balance, functional mobility and mood but Pilates seems to a better method than Ai-Chi for improving muscle strength, the level of perceived balance confidence and quality of life in patients with MS.",

"Title": "Comparing routine neurorehabilitation programme with callisthenic exercises in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "We conducted a study that examined the effectiveness of callisthenic exercises in multiple sclerosis. 30 individuals were divided into two groups. The first group did 15 callisthenic exercises and the second group did routine neurorehabilitation programme. Both groups did the programmes for three days per week over six weeks. Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F), muscle strength tests, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), Turkish versions of Short Form of 36 (SF-36), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) were used for evaluation. After physiotherapy programmes VAS-F, muscle strength, BBS scores decreased significantly in both groups. HAD anxiety score of the first group and HAD depression score of the second group changed significantly. There were no differences in MSFC and SF-36 scores in any groups. The difference between groups was not significant in any parameters, except for the muscle test for upper limbs of the second group. Callisthenic exercises are seen as a new therapy choice, which are different from routine exercises, in order to decrease fatigue, improve balance and muscle strength. Callisthenics are thought to be a beneficial tool for MS patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

"Title": "Mindfulness-based interventions in multiple sclerosis: beneficial effects of Tai Chi on balance, coordination, fatigue and depression",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) experience a wide array of symptoms, including balance problems, mobility impairment, fatigue and depression. Physical exercise has recently been acknowledged as a treatment option complementary to medication. However, information regarding putative effects of structured exercise programs on neurological symptoms is sparse. Tai Chi, a Chinese martial art incorporating physical exercise and mindfulness training, has been shown to yield health benefits in various neurological groups. It seems particularly suitable for patients with motoric deficits as it challenges coordination and balance. The purpose of the current study was to explore the therapeutic value of structured Tai Chi training for coordination, balance, fatigue and depression in mildly disabled MS patients. METHODS: A sample of 32 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS<5) was examined. A structured Tai Chi course was devised and a Tai Chi group participated in two weekly sessions of 90 minutes duration for six months, while a comparison group received treatment as usual (TAU). Both groups were examined prior to and following the six-months interval with regards to balance and coordination performance as well as measures of fatigue, depression and life satisfaction. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the Tai Chi group showed significant, consistent improvements in balance, coordination, and depression, relative to the TAU group (range of effect-sizes: partial eta2=0.16 - 0.20). Additionally, life satisfaction improved (partial eta2=0.31). Fatigue deteriorated in the comparison group, whereas it remained relatively stable in the Tai Chi group (partial eta2=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: The consistent pattern of results confirms that Tai Chi holds therapeutic potential for MS patients. Further research is needed to determine underlying working mechanisms, and to verify the results in a larger sample and different MS subgroups.",

"Abstract": "BACKROUND: The aim of our study is to examine effects of aerobic and Pilates exercises on disability, cognition, physical performance, balance, depression and fatigue in relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as compared to healthy controls. METHODS: The subjects were divided as aerobic exercise (n = 26), Pilates (n = 9), and the healthy control group (n = 21). We used MSFC, physical performance, Berg balance scale, Beck depression scale, fatigue impact scale. All evaluations were performed before and after exercise training. RESULTS: There are statistically meaningful differences between Nine hole testing, PASAT 3, physical performance and fatique impact scale before and after aerobic exercise. Also we found significant difference for physical performance in the Pilates group. There are no significant differences in measures of fatique impact scale and depression between aerobic exercise group and the healthy controls after exercise. We found significant differences between Pilates and control group's after measurements except depression. There were significant differences between the Pilates and aerobic group for cognitive tests in favor of the Pilates group. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise and clinical Pilates exercises revealed moderate changes in levels of cognitive, physical performance, balance, depression, fatigue in MS patients.",

INTERVENTION: Rehabilitation services for 5 hours, 1 day per week, over 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The MS-Related Symptom Checklist composite score, fatigue frequency, and selected items from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago Functional Assessment Scale. RESULTS: Receiving treatment was a significant predictor of reduced symptom frequency (partial r2 = .26) at the 1-year follow-up. The ES adjusted for baseline values indicated substantial reductions in symptom frequency for the treatment group (EStreatment = .27 vs ESwaitlist = -.32). Fatigue was significantly reduced at the time of follow-up for the treatment group compared with the waiting list group (EStreatment = .46 vs ESwaitlist = -.20). There were no statistically significant differences among groups regarding functional status, but there appeared to be less loss of functional status in the treatment group compared with the waiting list group (EStreatment = -.07 vs ESwaitlist = -.70). CONCLUSIONS: An extended outpatient rehabilitation program for persons with definite progressive MS appears to effectively reduce fatigue and the severity of other symptoms associated with MS.",

"Title": "The effects of aerobic training on the functional status, quality of life, the level of fatigue and disability in patients with multiple sclerosis-a preliminary report",
"Abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this paper was to assess the effects of aerobic training on the quality of life and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. Material and methods: A total of 53 patients with known multiple sclerosis (ICD G35.0) who began a standard 4-week rehabilitation programme were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: AT (aerobic training) patients (n = 21), who additionally underwent training on a lower limb cycle ergometer (three 10-minute sessions per day with an hour interval), and non-AT group of patients (n = 32). Life quality assessment based on the WHOQOL-BREF scale (World Health Organization Quality of Life), an assessment of motor impairment based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale by Kurtzke (EDSS) and an assessment of the severity of fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were performed at baseline and after four weeks. Results: After completing rehabilitation programmes, an improvement in the quality of life was observed both in AT and non-AT group. However, a more significant improvement in the two evaluated aspects, physical (p = 0.001 vs. 0.01) and psychological (p = 0.001 vs. 0.05), was observed in the AT group. However, no improvement in social terms was observed. There was also a reduction in the severity of fatigue (0.03 for AT group vs. 0.15 for non-AT group). There was no statistically significant improvement in the EDSS score in any of the groups. Conclusions: Aerobic training has beneficial effects on the quality of life and the severity of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.",

"Abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis disorders poses heavy physical and emotional effect on patients who are associated with the disease. Aim: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of individual versus group exercises on fatigue on patients with multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 85 patients with multiple sclerosis were divided in two groups of individualized exercise and team exercise. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks and comprised of mild stretching and basic yoga exercises twice a day. The data were collected through demographic questionnaire, standard fatigue scale and self-reported checklist. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software. Results: The mean levels of fatigue perception after the intervention in group exercise was 27.9 Ã‚Â± 15.9 and 27.1 Ã‚Â± 17.2 in individual exercise. There was no signifi cant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Statistically signifi cant difference was observed in the mean level of perceived fatigue in triplicate measurements (P = 0.013) among patients who completed individual exercise. However, this difference was not signifi cant in the group exercise. Conclusion: Performing mild stretching exercises and basic yoga are recommended as a cost-effective method which is easy to perform among patients with mild to moderate disabilities.",

"Title": "The efficacy of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in stable multiple sclerosis patients",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy of multidisciplinary, inpatient rehabilitation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, parallel group design was used. The intervention group were offered comprehensive, multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation at the Haslev MS Hospital for an average of 35.5 days, while the control group received no treatment related to the study. All patients were examined in their homes twice with a 10-week interval. The rehabilitation of the intervention group started 2-3 weeks after the first examination and ended 2-3 weeks before the second examination. Impairment was assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Impairment Scale and the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Disability was assessed by means of Guy's Neurological Disability Scale. Two specific scales were used to assess upper limb function and ambulation: The Nine-Hole Peg Test and timed 10-metre walking. Patients' own perception of bodily pain, bladder symptoms, spasticity, fatigue, impaired walking and transfers were recorded using visual analogue scales. Finally, quality of life was assessed using the Life Appreciation and Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Functional Assessment in Multiple Sclerosis. PATIENTS: Two hundred and thirty-three patients were screened and of those 38 were included for treatment and 52 as controls. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Although the study was underpowered, the negative outcome exposes the difficulties in quantitative analyses of the efficacy of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, which is liable to confounding factors such as variation in the indication for treatment, in the placebo effect, and in the reliability and responsiveness of the outcome measures.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by fatigue, motor weakness, and spasticity, to name a few. MS symptoms may lead to physical inactivity associated with the development of secondary diseases. This study was to investigate the effect of regular aerobic and yoga on the quality of life of patients with MS. METHODS: The present quasi-experimental study was conducted on 90 patients with chronic MS chosen randomly and divided into two test and one control groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 11.5) through paired t-test, ANOVA, and Tukey's post hoc. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the scores of quality of life in the three groups prior to investigation. Although they were significant after intervention. The mean score of yoga group was higher than that of aerobic group, and aerobic group showed a higher mean score compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Yoga and aerobic exercises may improve quality of life in patients with MS. It is highly recommended that the governor along with MS societies and other organizations servicing and supporting patients start to develop sport-regulated programs to help improve quality of life for these patients.",

"Abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of four different programmes on spiroergometric, spirometric and clinical parameters in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. METHODS: One hundred and twelve MS patients were divided into four groups. The first group underwent neurophysiologically based physiotherapy, the second aerobic training, the third combined therapy (neurophysiologically based physiotherapy and aerobic training) and the fourth did not change any habits. Seventeen patients did not finish the study. Patients were examined on impairment (Expanded Disability Status Scale), disability (Barthel Index), handicap (Environment Status Scale), quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory Score), respiratory function (spirometric parameters on spirometry) and physical fitness (spiroergometric parameters on a bicycle ergometer). RESULTS: The patients who participated in one of our training programmes showed a significant improvement of the examined parameters in comparison to those who did not change their present habits. Each of the four training programmes had a different impact on the parameters, which means that each of them had a different effect. The neurophysiologically based physiotherapy had the greatest impact on impairment, and the aerobic training on spirometric and spiroergometric parameters. All methods (the neurophysiologically based physiotherapy, the aerobic training and the combined programme) had an impact on fatigue.",

"Title": "The effects of Pilates-fisios on pain, motor fatigue, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled clinical trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Pain and fatigue are common symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) that patients identify as interfering most with their daily activities. Motor disturbances associated with spasticity are also likely to contribute to the fatigue and pain. According to the recent recommendations, treatment strategies for pain and fatigue management in MS are to progress. There are evidences as to Pilates developing balance, mobility and muscle strength of MS patients but the effects on pain and fatigue are not known. Aims: The goals of this study is to investigate the effect of Pilates- Fisios on pain, motor fatigue, in outpatients with MS and its impact on quality of life. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial study, 20 MS patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 10 patients each. The experimental group began to follow the Pilates-Fisios training for two months in one-hour sessions twice a week for a total of 16 sessions, whereas the control group received an exercise program consisted of Muscle Relaxation Technique, Aerobic and Respiratory Exercises, with the same timing. Both the experimental and control groups were evaluated using a questionnaires for Motor Fatigue with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), for Quality of Life with Functional Assessment Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain before and after the interventions and they were assessed after one month from the end of training. Results: There is significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS) (p=0.001) as well as improvement in quality of life (FAMS) after the Pilates-Fisios training. There are no significant differences into two groups about the impact on Motor Fatigue. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of positive effects on pain intensity and almost all domains of quality of life for patients followed the Pilates-Fisios exercises respect on the other program of control group.",

"Title": "Walking improvement after deep rTMS with H-coil associated with rehabilitation in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis: A randomised, controlled, double-blind study",
"Abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether repeated sessions of transcranial repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with H-coil could enhance the benefit of rehabilitation on walking abilities in patients with spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Background: Impaired walking has a strong impact on disability associated with MS and its treatments options are limited. Preliminary findings showed that repeated sessions of focal repetitive transcranial stimulation improved spasticity associated with MS but no data are aviable on the impact on walking ability. Recently, the development of H-coils has been proved to allow reaching deeper brain regions as compared with focal stimulation. Design/Methods: Twenty-three progressive MS patients with lower limb spasticity, undergoing inpatients rehabilitation, were randomized to receive real (11 pts) or sham (11 pts; one patient refused to partecipate after randomization) 10-min sessions of high-frequency rTMS for 3 weeks following their rehabilitation sessions. Primary outcome was percent change at the 10-meter walk test. Secondary outcomes were: walking endurance (6-min walking test), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Visual Analogue Scale for spasticity, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), EDSS, PASAT and Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Results: At the end of treatment, both groups showed improvement in all outcome parameters, although improvement in walking tests (10-mt-WT and 6-min-WT) was significant in the real rTMS group only. The latter group, when compared with the sham group, had significantly better improvement of the primary outcome (10-mt-WT; p<0.05) and 6-min.WT (p=0,002) and MAS score (p=0.037). No serious adverse effects were reported and no patient discontinued the study due to adverse effects. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that deep brain stimulation with H-Coil increases the effects of rehabilitation in improving walking ability, in terms of both speed and endurance. The treatment is safe and feasible. These encouraging results need to be validated with phase-3 studies.",

"Title": "Is it feasible to exercise severely disabled patients with multiple sclerosis?",
"Abstract": "Background: Research on the effects of exercise therapy in severely disabled (EDSS >6.0) patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) is deficient. Objective: To evaluate whether upper body endurance training (ET) is 1) safe and tolerable and 2) can be executed at a sufficient volume and intensity to expectedly induce cardio-vascular adaptations over time. Methods: Eleven PMS patients (6.5=EDSS=8.0) were randomized to either a control group (n = 5,4F/1M, 55.2Ã‚Â±8.2y,169.0Ã‚Â± 10.3cm,84.5Ã‚Â±20.5kg,3SP/2PP, EDSS:7.3Ã‚Â±0.6) or to an intervention group (n = 6,4F/2M, 62.0Ã‚Â±5.8y,172.3Ã‚Â±8.7cm, 71.9Ã‚Â±6.3kg, 5SP/1PP,EDSS:7.0Ã‚Â±0.4). Both groups received a four week inpatient programme with individualized MS rehabilitation and within same period the intervention group completed 10 sessions of upper body ET (six 3 minute intervals at a heart rate corresponding to 65-75% of VO2-peak). All ET sessions were performed using fitness equipment designed for persons with impaired leg function. Primary outcome measures were tolerance to ET and training quality. Before and after the four week intervention period all patients completed VO2-peak testing (incremental arm exercise test performed on a Monark Ergomedic 834E bicycle ergometer), tests of physical function (9 hole peg test , hand grip strength, Box and Block test and 6 minute wheelchair test) and fulfilled questionnaires on depression, disease impact and fatigue (MDI, MSIS-29, FSMC). Results: One patient from the EXE group was excluded from the analysis, because the patient had to be hospitalized during the intervention, giving a drop-out rate of 1/6~17%. No adverse events were recorded. Participants in the EXE group completed on average 9.3Ã‚Â±0.8 sessions of the planned 10 sessions (~96.0Ã‚Â±5%). An average heart rate of 93.9Ã‚Â±9.3beats*min-1 were sustained during the ET sessions corresponding to 91.6Ã‚Â±6.8% of the maximal pre-intervention heart rate. An average Borg score of 14.6Ã‚Â±1.7 were registered during the ET sessions. Four participants in the EXE group showed improved VO2- max, while none of the participants in the CON group showed improvements. Comparison of the changes (EXE: 308Ã‚Â±312ml O2/min vs. CON: 2Ã‚Â±30ml O2/min) in VO2-max showed a tendency towards a groups difference (p = 0.06). When changes in all other measures of physical function and questionnaires were compared no significant group differences were found. Conclusion: ET is feasible and safe in severely disabled patients with MS and ET can probably be performed at sufficient intensity to induce increases in VO2-max.",

"Title": "Exercise Training in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: A Comparison of Recumbent Stepping and Body Weight-Supported Treadmill Training",
"Abstract": "Background: There is evidence of the benefits of exercise training in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, few studies have been conducted in individuals with progressive MS and severe mobility impairment. A potential exercise rehabilitation approach is total-body recumbent stepper training (TBRST). We evaluated the safety and participant-reported experience of TBRST in people with progressive MS and compared the efficacy of TBRST with that of body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) on outcomes of function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods: Twelve participants with progressive MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, 6.0-8.0) were randomized to receive TBRST or BWSTT. Participants completed three weekly sessions (30 minutes) of exercise training for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes included safety assessed as adverse events and patient-reported exercise experience assessed as postexercise response and evaluation of exercise equipment. Secondary outcomes included the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 questionnaire scores. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Safety was confirmed in both exercise groups. Participants reported enjoying both exercise modalities; however, TBRST was reviewed more favorably. Both interventions reduced fatigue and improved HRQOL (P = .05); there were no changes in function. Conclusions: Both TBRST and BWSTT seem to be safe, well tolerated, and enjoyable for participants with progressive MS with severe disability. Both interventions may also be efficacious for reducing fatigue and improving HRQOL. TBRST should be further explored as an exercise rehabilitation tool for patients with progressive MS.",

"Title": "Heat sensitive persons with multiple sclerosis are more tolerant to resistance exercise than to endurance exercise",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heat sensitivity (HS) is reported by 58% of all persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), causing symptom exacerbation possibly limiting exercise participation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that (a) a relationship between exercise-induced changes in core-temperature (C(temp)) and changes in symptom intensity exists, and (b) that resistance exercise (RE), as a consequence of a minor increase in core temperature, will induce a lesser worsening of symptoms than endurance exercise (EE) in HS persons with MS. METHODS: On two separate days, 16 HS persons with MS randomly completed a session of RE and EE, or EE and RE, respectively. Testing was conducted pre, post and one hour after exercise and consisted of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scoring (fatigue, spasticity, pain, strength, walking and balance), the 5-time sit-to-stand (5STS), the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and Body Sway. Composite scores describing average subjective symptom intensity (SI) and total number of symptoms (SN) were calculated from VAS scores. RESULTS: C(temp) (0.9+/-0.4degreeC vs 0.3+/-0.1degreeC, p<0.001), SI (1.7+/-1.9 cm vs 0.6+/-1.5 cm, p<0.05) and SN (1.6+/-1.9 vs 0.6+/-2.1, p<0.05) increased significantly more during EE than RE. Changes in C(temp) correlated to changes in SI (r=0.50, p<0.01). No differences were observed in 5STS, MSFC and Body Sway scores after EE when compared to RE. CONCLUSION: An exercise-induced increase in C(temp) is associated with increased number and severity of perceived symptoms in HS persons with MS. Based on these findings it is expected that HS persons with MS do tolerate RE better than EE.",

"Title": "Influence of sports climbing and yoga on spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Objectives: Spasticity, cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue significantly reduce the quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. To find out whether nonpharmalogical treatment approaches can reduce these symptoms we investigated effects of sports climbing (SC) and yoga on spasticity, cognitive impairment, mood change and fatigue in MS patients. Sports climbing (SC) and yoga are aerobic physical activities comprised a series of stretching techniques, implementation of which demands body control and planning of complex movements. Materials and methods: 20 subjects with relapsing-remitting or progressive MS, 26-50 years of age, with EDSS (less-than or equal to) 6 and EDSS pyramidal functions score (EDSSpyr) > 2 were enrolled in a randomized prospective study. The participants were randomly divided into SC and yoga group. We evaluated spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue before and after both programs, that lasted 10 weeks, with standardized assessment methods. Results: There were no significant improvements in spasticity after SC and yoga. In the SC group we found a 25% reduction (p = 0.046) in EDSSpyr. There were no differences in executive function after the completion of both programs. There was a 17% increase in selective attention performance after yoga (p = 0.005). SC reduced fatigue for 32.5% (p = 0.015), while yoga had no effect. We found no significant impact of SC and yoga on mood. Conclusions: Yoga and SC might improve some of the MS symptoms and should be considered in the future as possible complementary treatments. (copyright) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

"Title": "The effects of robot-assisted gait training on locomotor function in subjects with multiple sclerosis: A three months follow-up study",
"Abstract": "Introduction Gait disabilities are very common in multiple sclerosis with a negative impact on personal activities and quality of life. It has been shown that human brain is capable of significant modification providing that the quantity (duration and frequency) and quality (task specificity) of rehabilitative interventions are appropriate to facilitate neuroplasticity and motor learning [1]. The aims of this study is to test the effects of robot-assisted gait training in mid-functioning multiple sclerosis subjects on spatiotemporal gait parameters and locomotor function. Materials and methods This is a pilot randomized single blind trial. Multiple sclerosis subjects with no relapse during the last 6 months and gait impairments defined as Expanded Disability Status Scale from 4.5 to 6.5 wereenrolled. Participants have been randomized to robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) or conventional therapy (CT). The experimental group received 12 robot-assisted gait training session over 6 weeks (2 sessions/week). The control group received 12 conventional therapy sessions over 6 weeks (2 sessions/week). Primary outcome measures were spatiotemporal gait parameters obtained with a stereophotogrammetric system with 6 infrared cameras (VICON 460, Vicon Motion System Ltd., UK). Secondary outcome measures included clinical tests as the six-minute walking test (SMWT), the Berg Balance Test (BBT) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). Self-reported questionnaire on motor fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) was submitted. Outcome measures were assessed pre-post-training and after 3 months. Results Twenty subjects were randomized, ten to RAGT and ten to conventional therapy. Three subjects dropped out due to medical conditions. Spatiotemporal gait parameters showed an overall improvement after training in the RAGT group: walking speed improved from 0.57Ã‚Â±0.24 to 0.65Ã‚Â±0.21 (p < 0.0001) and 0.6Ã‚Â±0.23 at 3 months (Fig. 1); cadence improved after treatment from 76.9Ã‚Â±24.5 to 83.1Ã‚Â±21.1 (p < 0.0001) and was sustained (80.1Ã‚Â±21.1); double support was reduced from 0.80Ã‚Â±0.67 to 0.60Ã‚Â±0.51 (p < 0.0001) and 0.64Ã‚Â±0.57 at 3 months. There were no differences in walking speed and cadence in the conventional therapy group. Walking endurance was improved by an average of 40.2m in the RAGT group (p < 0.01), compared to ?0.1min the CT group after training. At 3 months RAGT group still improved in walking endurance by an average of 53.9m(p < 0.01) in (Figure presented) the SMWT. Better performance was also noted in the TUG and BBT scores in the RAGT group. Subjects also reported a reduced motor fatigue after training. Discussion Robot-assisted gait training seems to be effective in restoring walking competency in mid-functioning multiple sclerosis subjects. These results were partially retained at 3 months follow-up.",

"Title": "Improvements in cognition, quality of life, and physical performance with clinical Pilates in multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "[Purpose] The aim of this study was to determine the effects of clinical Pilates in multiple sclerosis patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty multiple sclerosis patients were enrolled in this study. The participants were divided into two groups as the clinical Pilates and control groups. Cognition (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite), balance (Berg Balance Scale), physical performance (timed performance tests, Timed up and go test), tiredness (Modified Fatigue Impact scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire) were measured before and after treatment in all participants. [Results] There were statistically significant differences in balance, timed performance, tiredness and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite tests between before and after treatment in the clinical Pilates group. We also found significant differences in timed performance tests, the Timed up and go test and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite between before and after treatment in the control group. According to the difference analyses, there were significant differences in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire scores between the two groups in favor of the clinical Pilates group. There were statistically significant clinical differences in favor of the clinical Pilates group in comparison of measurements between the groups. Clinical Pilates improved cognitive functions and quality of life compared with traditional exercise. [Conclusion] In Multiple Sclerosis treatment, clinical Pilates should be used as a holistic approach by physical therapists.",

"Title": "Comparing endurance- and resistance-exercise training in people with multiple sclerosis: a randomized pilot study",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare adaptations in functional and quality of life measures following endurance- and resistance-exercise training in people with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Cross-over design with an eight-week washout period. SETTING: Community health centre. SUBJECTS: Sixteen individuals with multiple sclerosis. INTERVENTION: Subjects completed both an eight-week endurance- and an eight-week resistance-exercise training programme in a randomized order. The exercise training comprised individualized progressive programmes that were completed twice weekly in a supervised group setting. MAIN MEASURES: Grip strength, functional reach, four step square, timed up and go and six-minute walk tests, Multiple Sclerosis Impact and Modified Fatigue Impact Scales, Becks Depression Inventory and the Health Status Questionnaire Short Form-36. RESULTS: Sixteen of 21 (76%) subjects completed the study. Subjects attended 13.2+/-1.6 endurance- and 15.8+/-1.9 resistance-exercise training sessions. No adverse events were reported. No significant differences (P<0.05) in any outcome measures were observed between the two exercise training programmes either at baseline or following the completion of both training programmes. CONCLUSION: Both endurance- and resistance-exercise training were well tolerated and appear to provide similar effects for people with multiple sclerosis, but larger studies are required to confirm these findings.",

"Title": "Effects of high-intensity resistance training on strength, mobility, balance, and fatigue in individuals with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically induced work (RENEW) has been shown to be associated with improvements in strength, mobility, and balance in multiple clinical populations. However, RENEW has not been reported for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Nineteen individuals with MS (8 men, 11 women; age mean = 49 Ã‚Â± 11 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] mean = 5.2 Ã‚Â± 0.9) were randomized into either standard exercise (STAND) or standard exercise and RENEW training (RENEW) for 3Ãƒâ€”/week for 12 weeks. Outcome measures were lower extremity strength (hip/knee flexion and extension, ankle plantar and dorsiflexion, and the sum of these individual values [sum strength]); Timed Up and Go (TUG), 10-m walk, self-selected pace (TMWSS) and maximal-pace (TMWMP), stair ascent (S-A) and descent (S-D) and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: No significant time effects or interactions were observed for strength, TUG, TMWSS, TMWMP, or 6MWT. However, the mean difference in sum strength in the RENEW group was 38.60 (representing a 15% increase) compared to the sum strength observed in the STAND group with a mean difference of 5.58 (a 2% increase). A significant interaction was observed for S-A, S-D, and BBS as the STAND group improved whereas the RENEW group did not improve in these measures. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to results in other populations, the addition of eccentric training to standard exercises did not result in significantly greater lower extremity strength gains in this group of individuals with MS. Further this training was not as effective as standard exercise alone in improving balance or the ability to ascend and descend stairs. Following data collection, reassessment of required sample size indicates we were likely underpowered to detect strength differences between groups.",

"Title": "Robot-assisted vs. sensory integration training in treating gait and balance dysfunctions in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Extensive research on both healthy subjects and patients with central nervous damage has elucidated a crucial role of postural adjustment reactions and central sensory integration processes in generating and shaping\" locomotor function, respectively. Whether robotic-assisted gait devices might improve these functions in Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is not fully investigated in literature. Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of end-effector robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) and sensory integration balance training (SIBT) in improving walking and balance performance in patients with MS. Methods: Twenty-two patients with MS (EDSS: 1.5-6.5) were randomly assigned to two groups. The RAGT group (n = 12) underwent end-effector system training. The SIBT group (n = 10) underwent specific balance exercises. Each patient received twelve 50-min treatment sessions (2 days/week). A blinded rater evaluated patients before and after treatment as well as 1 month post treatment. Primary outcomes were walking speed and Berg Balance Scale. Secondary outcomes were the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Sensory Organization Balance Test, Stabilometric Assessment, Fatigue Severity Scale, cadence, step length, single and double support time, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54. Results: Between groups comparisons showed no significant differences on primary and secondary outcome measures over time. Within group comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups on the Berg Balance Scale (P = 0.001). Changes approaching significance were found on gait speed (P = 0.07) only in the RAGT group. Significant changes in balance task-related domains during standing and walking conditions were found in the SIBT group. Conclusion: Balance disorders in patients with MS may be ameliorated by RAGT and by SIBT. Ã‚Â© 2014 Gandolfi, Geroin, Picelli, Munari, Waldner, Tamburin, Marchioretto and Smania.",

"Title": "Intensity of treadmill walking exercise on acute mood symptoms in persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: An acute bout of moderate-intensity treadmill walking exercise has previously been associated with improvements in overall mood disturbance and vigor, without worsening fatigue, among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).This study examined the effects of light-, moderate-, and high-intensity bouts of treadmill walking exercise on immediate and delayed mood states in MS. DESIGN: This was a within-subjects, randomized, and counter-balanced study. METHODS: 23 women and 1 man with MS undertook 20-minute bouts of light-, moderate-, and high-intensity treadmill walking, and seated quiet rest. Participants completed the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after each condition. Total mood disturbance (TMD) and six subscales of the POMS were analyzed using 2-way, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: There was a significant condition-by-time interaction on TMD scores ([Formula: see text]) and vigor scores ([Formula: see text]). The moderate-intensity treadmill walking yielded the largest improvements in TMD and vigor immediately post-condition (p?<?.05). These improvements were no longer significant at 45 minutes post-condition (p?>?.05). CONCLUSION: TMD and vigor improved immediately after moderate-intensity walking, but the changes dissipated over time. Fatigue did not worsen after any of the walking conditions. These results indicate that an acute bout of moderate-intensity walking may help with mood management in persons with MS, without worsening fatigue.",

"Title": "Depression, fatigue, and health-related quality of life among people with advanced multiple sclerosis: results from an exploratory telerehabilitation study",
"Abstract": "This study reports on secondary data, depression, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), collected on people with advanced multiple sclerosis (MS) as part of a larger study of the impact of a telerehabilitation intervention on people with severe mobility impairment. People with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) (n=111) and the prevention of pressure sores were the primary group of interest of the project. The focus here is on data collected from people with advanced MS (n=27), who were included as an exploratory cohort, as they experience increased risk of pressure ulcer development as their level of mobility declines. The study consisted of a nine-week intervention with three randomized groups: video, telephone, and standard care. Aside from information on pressure sores, data were also collected on fatigue, depression, and HRQOL for a two-year follow-up period. For the video group HRQOL scores trended higher and fatigue and depression scores lower for 24 months. Fatigue scores were significantly lower for the video group at month six, 12, and 18. In the sample overall, fatigue symptoms were far more prominent than depressive symptoms and affected 100% higher rates of depression than women. At baseline, controlling for Extended Disability Status Score (EDSS), depression and fatigue were correlated. However, contrary to indications from previous cross-sectional studies, no consistent relationship was observed over time between the two. Telerehabilitation interventions for people with advanced MS warrant further investigation. Findings here suggest that such interventions may be beneficial, although the results need affirmation through larger samples. In addition, the higher prevalence of male depression merits serious attention.",

"Title": "Effects of Intermittent Versus Continuous Walking on Distance Walked and Fatigue in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Crossover Trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fatigue is a common, disabling symptom experienced by persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Evidence shows that intermittent exercise is associated in improved performance and negligible fatigue. The purpose of this study was to examine whether subjects with MS walk greater distances with less fatigue under intermittent (INT) or continuous (CONT) walking condition. METHODS: Twenty-seven subjects with MS (median Extended Disability Severity Scale 3.5, interquartile range 1.6) walked in the CONT (ie, 6 uninterrupted minutes) and INT (ie, three 2-minute walking bouts) conditions in a randomized crossover. Distance was measured for the entire 6-minute walking period and each 2-minute increment. Fatigue was measured as the difference in a visual analog scale of fatigue (DELTAVAS-F) immediately preceding and following each trial. RESULTS: Participants walked greater distances in the INT condition compared to the CONT condition (P = 0.005). There was a significant interaction of walking condition and time (P < 0.001), indicating that the distances walked in the INT condition changed across time. DELTAVAS-F was significantly lower in the INT condition than in the CONT condition (P = 0.036). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Subjects with MS walked farther, and with less fatigue, when walking intermittently rather than continuously. Persons with MS may be able to tolerate a greater dose of walking training if the walking bouts are intermittent. Further study to determine the benefits of a walking exercise program using intermittent walking is recommended.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A103).",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial of exercise interventions to improve sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in individuals with multiple sclerosis: A pilot study",
"Abstract": "Background: Nearly 70% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience sleep disturbances. Increasing physical activity in people with MS has been shown to produce a moderate improvement in sleep quality, and exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality in non-neurologically impaired adults. Objective: The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial study was to examine the effect of two exercise interventions on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in individuals with MS. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals with relapsingÃ¢â‚¬â€œremitting or secondary progressive MS were randomized into one of two 12-week exercise interventions: a supervised, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (AE) program or an unsupervised, low-intensity walking and stretching (WS) program. Only individuals who were = 70% compliant with the programs were included in analysis (n = 12 AE; n = 10 WS). Results: Both groups demonstrated a moderate improvement in sleep quality, although only the improvement by the WS group was statistically significant. Only the AE group demonstrated a significant improvement in daytime sleepiness. Change in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness was not correlated with disease severity or with change in cardiovascular fitness, depression, or fatigue. Conclusion: The mechanisms for improvement in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness need further investigation, but may be due to introduction of zeitgebers to improve circadian rhythm.",

"Title": "Telerehabilitation in multiple sclerosis: Results of a randomized, 3-arm, rater blinded, feasibility and efficacy pilot study; patient-reported outcomes report",
"Abstract": "Background: MS commonly results in physical and cognitive disability. Functional improvement of established physical deficits can be achieved through rehabilitation methods to include physical therapy (PT). Access to specialized rehabilitation services is limited due to a variety of factors including availability, geographical distance, mobility limitations, transportation difficulties, and financial constraints. Telecommunication technology offers the capacity to supervise and direct a PT program remotely through audio and visual real-time communication. Objectives: Demonstrate the feasibility of a tele-health rehabilitation program in individuals with ambulatory deficits secondary to MS and to evaluate its efficacy when compared to conventional physical therapy. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, three-arm, evaluator blinded, 8-week study. Thirty individuals were included (female 69%, mean age 54.7 years, RMS 60%. SPMS 23%, PPMS 17%, mean EDSS 4.3). A home-based exercise program (HEP) was performed unsupervised 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Interventions were as follows: Group 1- HEP alone; Group 2- HEP plus remote PT supervised via audio and visual real-time telecommunication 2-3 times per week; Group 3- HEP plus in-person PT at the medical facility 2-3 times per week. Patient-reported outcomes and gait and balance assessments (reported separately) were performed. Results: Patient-reported outcomes showed improvement from baseline in the Modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS) for groups 2 (p=0.05) and 3 (p=0.01) and SF36-mental (SF36m) for groups 2 (p=0.04) and 3 (p=0.01). Groups 2 and 3 were comparatively equivalent in SF36m p=0.06, balance confidence p=0.47, MFIS p=0.37, and self-efficacy p=0.79. Group 3 was better than groups 1 and 2 only in the SF36-physical. One participant dropped out due to an MS relapse. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation is a convenient and practical method to perform PT in MS individuals and is overall equivalent to conventional in-person PT as measured by patient reported outcomes of fatigue, confidence and self-efficacy. Gait and balance outcomes were also favorable and are presented separately. Telerehabilitation should be researched further and used more extensively as a mean to improve function and quality of life in MS.",

"Title": "Resistance Training for Muscle Weakness in Multiple Sclerosis: Direct Versus Contralateral Approach in Individuals With Ankle Dorsiflexors' Disparity in Strength",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of contralateral strength training (CST) and direct strength training of the more affected ankle dorsiflexors on muscle performance and clinical functional outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibiting interlimb strength asymmetry. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (N=30) and mild-to-moderate disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score <=6) presenting with ankle dorsiflexors' strength disparity. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to a CST (n=15) or direct strength training (n=15) group performing 6 weeks of maximal intensity strength training of the less or more affected dorsiflexors, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximal strength, endurance to fatigue, and mobility outcomes were assessed before, at the intervention end, and at 12-week follow-up. Strength and fatigue parameters were measured after 3 weeks of training (midintervention). RESULTS: In the more affected limb of both groups, pre- to postintervention significant increases in maximal strength (P<=.006) and fatigue endurance (P<=.04) were detected along with consistent retention of these improvements at follow-up (P<=.04). At midintervention, the direct strength training group showed significant improvements (P<=.002), with no further increase at postintervention, despite training continuation. Conversely, the CST group showed nonsignificant strength gains, increasing to significance at postintervention (P<=.003). In both groups, significant pre- to postintervention improvements in mobility outcomes (P<=.03), not retained at follow-up, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: After 6 weeks of training, CST proved as effective as direct strength training in enhancing performance of the more affected limb with a different time course, which may have practical implications in management of severely weakened limbs where direct strength training is not initially possible.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Effects of endurance training in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients complaining of motor fatigue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty MS patients complaining of fatigue with low to moderate disabilities randomly allocated to the intervention (thrice weekly 45-min intervals of endurance exercise) or control treatment (three 45-min episodes of stretching, balance training and coordination), both as 'add-on' therapy for 3 weeks during inpatient rehabilitation. RESULTS: Maximal walking distance before intervention averaged 1043 +/- 568 and 1163 +/- 750 m in the two groups. The intervention group increased its maximal walking distance by 650 +/- 474 m. The control group extended its walking distance by 96 +/- 70 m. CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm a strong effect of endurance exercise on maximal walking distance.

"Abstract": "Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system that results in many symptoms including mobility limitation and fatigue. Patients and Methods: Thirty-one MS patients, all female with mean of age of 36.75 years and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) of 1.0 to 4.0 were recruited. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: treadmill training, yoga or control groups. Treadmill training and yoga practice consisted of 8 weeks (24 sessions, thrice weekly). The control group followed their own routine treatment program. Balance, speed and endurance of walking, fatigue, depression and anxiety were measured by Berg Balance scores, time for 10m walk and distance for a two minute walk, Fatigue Severity Scale (FFS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively. Results: Comparison of results have shown that pre- and post-interventions produced significant improvements in the balance score, walking endurance, FFS score, BDI score and BAI score in the treadmill training group and yoga group. However, 10m walk time decreased in the treadmill training group but did not show any clear change in the yoga group. Moreover, the analysis showed significant differences between the treadmill training group and yoga group for BAI score. Conclusions: These results suggest that treadmill training and yoga practice improved ambulatory function, fatigue and mood status in the individuals with mild to moderate MS.

"Title": "Tailored balance exercises on people with multiple sclerosis: A pilot randomized, controlled study",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Altered integration of signals from visual (VIS), somatosensory (PROP) and vestibular system (VEST) lead to balance control impairments affecting the daily living activities of patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). As a consequence, tailored interventions could be crucial in improving efficacy of balance rehabilitation treatments. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to assess the efficacy of tailored rehabilitation treatments for balance disorders based on visual, somatosensory and vestibular deficits versus traditional rehabilitation exercises. METHODS: Thirty-two PwMS were assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the composite score (CS) obtained by computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) test and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Based on CDP analysis, prevalent VIS, PROP or VEST deficits were identified and patients randomly allocated to a personalized (PRG) or traditional (TRG) rehabilitation group. RESULTS: BBS score showed a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment scores of 6.3 and 2.0 points respectively for PRG and TRG. CS showed a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment scores of 16.6 and 7.6 points respectively for PRG and TRG. No interaction effect was found for MFIS score. CONCLUSIONS: BBS and CS showed changes in the PRG group that met clinical relevant difference, underlining that tailored rehabilitation interventions based on patient-specific sensory system impairment could improve balance and postural control in PwMS.

"Title": "Uphill and Downhill Walking in Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various exercise protocols have been recommended for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated the effects of uphill and downhill walking exercise on mobility, functional activities, and muscle strength in MS patients. METHODS: Thirty-four MS patients were randomly allocated to either the downhill or uphill treadmill walking group for 12 sessions (3 times/wk) of 30 minutes' walking on a 10% negative slope (n = 17) or a 10% positive slope (n = 17), respectively. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention and after 4-week follow-up and included fatigue by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale; mobility by Modified Rivermead Mobility Index; disability by Guy's Neurological Disability Scale; functional activities by 2-Minute Walk Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk test, and Timed Up and Go test; balance indices by Biodex Balance System; and quadriceps and hamstring isometric muscles by torque of left and right knee joints. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to investigate the intervention effects on the measurements. RESULTS: After the intervention, significant improvement was found in the downhill group versus the uphill group in terms of fatigue, mobility, and disability indices; functional activities; balance indices; and quadriceps isometric torque (P < .05). The results were stable at 4-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Downhill walking on a treadmill may improve muscle performance, functional activity, and balance control in MS patients. These findings support the idea of using eccentric exercise training in MS rehabilitation protocols.",

"Title": "Effectiveness of balance disorders rehabiliation treatments in multiple sclerosis subjects: A pilot randomized control trial assessing the wii balance board gaming system",
"Abstract": "Objective: Balance disorders are frequently observed in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) leading to impaired balance and increased risk of falls. New rehabilitation approaches are crucial to improve the efficacy of interventions and to stimulate subjects' attention during the rehabilitation treatment. Aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of balance disorder rehabilitation in MS subjects with a portable and widely available force platform (Wii Balance Board) versus a traditional rehabilitation program. Design: Randomized control trial. MS subjects with balance disorders were selected and randomized into 2 groups: Wii Balance Board group - W group and Control group - C group. All subjects were evaluated with EDSS, Ambulation Index (AI), Berg Balance Scale (BERG), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), stabilometric recording with open eyes (STABOE) and closed eyes (STABCE) at T0 (begin of rehabilitation program) and at T1 (end of rehabilitation program). Setting: Clinical evaluation and rehabilitation treatment were performed in AISM rehabilitation centre for MS outpatients. Participants: 36 MS subjects, mean age 43.58Ã‚Â± 12.46 years, mean EDSS 4.17Ã‚Â± 1.61. Interventions: All participants received a rehabilitation treatment (12 sessions, 60 minutes each) with a standardized protocol for the C group and a Wii Balance Board protocol for W group. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was Berg balance scale, secondary outcomes were Ambulation Index, MFIS, STABOE and STABCE. Results: For W group data showed statistically significant differences between T0 and T1 for all outcomes considered in the study. In particular AI, MFIS and BERG showed a P<.001. STABOE and STABCE showed a P<.05. For C group data showed statistically significant differences between T0 and T1 for AI and MFIS (P<.05), whereas non-statistically significant differences were found for BERG, STABOE, and STABCE. Conclusions: Balance rehabilitation with a portable, widely used, force platform appeared to be a useful tool in improving balance skills in subjects with MS. The results of this study will serve as the basis for a larger trial.",

"Title": "Effects of a Short Physical Exercise Intervention on Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to investigate if a short-term endurance or combined endurance/resistance exercise program was sufficient to improve aerobic capacity and maximum force in adult patients (18-65 years) with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: All patients performed a three-month exercise program consisting of two training sessions per week, lasting 40 min each, with moderate intensity. All patients had a maximum value of 6 (low to moderate disability) on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). One group (combined workout group (CWG); 15 females, 4 males) completed a combined endurance/resistance workout (20 min on a bicycle ergometer, followed by 20 min of resistance training), while the other group (endurance workout group (EWG); 13 females, 5 males) completed a 40 min endurance training program. Aerobic capacity was assessed as peak oxygen uptake, ventilatory anaerobic threshold, and workload expressed as Watts. Maximum force of knee and shoulder extensors and flexors was measured using isokinetic testing. Quality of life was assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire, and fatigue was measured using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. RESULTS: Both training groups increased in aerobic capacity and maximum force. EWG, as well as CWG, showed improvement in several subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire and decrease of their fatigue. CONCLUSION: A short exercise intervention increased both aerobic capacity and maximum force independent of whether endurance or combined endurance/resistance workouts were performed.",

"Abstract": "Background and aims: The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of mat Pilates and reformer Pilates on balance, strength, mobility, fatigue and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Study planned randomized, controlled, singleblind. Patients (EDSS=4) are divided into 3 groups; Mat Pilates (n=12), Reformer Pilates (n=13) and control group (n=13). Patients were evaluated with Berg Balance Scale, static balance tests, Timed Up and Go test, Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQOL-54). Additionally extremities muscle strength and core endurance-power were evaluated. Results: As a result of mat Pilates and reformer Pilates applications, in both groups balance, mobility, upper lower extremity muscle strength, Ã¢â‚¬Å“coreÃ¢â‚¬Â of stability and quality of life was increased (p<0.05), fatigue was observed as reduced (p<0.05). There was no difference in the control group (except for physical and psychosocial dimensions of FIS and physical dimensions of MSQOL-54) (p>0.05). When the amount of change was compared in two Pilates groups, in the development of left hip flexion, right hip extension, right shoulder flexion and right elbow flexion muscle strength was higher in the Reformer Pilates group (p<0.05) in the other parameters was observed that the gain was similar (p>0.05). Conclusion: In light of these results mat Pilates or reformer Pilates in patients with MS seems to be effective in improving balance, strength, mobility, fatigue and quality of life, and there is no significant difference between the two methods.",

"Title": "Robot-assisted gait training in subjects affected by multiple sclerosis: Effects on locomotor function and motor unit firing",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Locomotor disability in persons with Multiple Sclerosis can be considered as an emergent characteristic deriving from several mechanisms of functional impairments, including coordination of posture and gait [1]. It has been previously reported that multiple sclerosis impairs neuromuscular recruitment as a result of the demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that affects upper motor neurons. This central impairment has been shown to decrease maximal voluntary motor unit firing rates which results in reduced force production. Gait training with orthosis Lokomat may offer advantages beyond over-ground training, in terms of patient safety, reduced fear of falling, more steps practiced, and repeatability of a consistent gait pattern [2]. It seems important to study muscle force and the firing rate of motor units to fully understand the etiology of muscle weakness in multiple sclerosis subjects and the effects of specific rehabilitative training programs [3]. Methods: We studied 40 MS patients (mean age 53Ã‚Â±10 years) with no relapse during the last six months and moderate to severe gait impairments defined as Expanded Disability Status Scale (score: 6-7). Subjects have been randomized to Robot Assisted Gait Training (RAGT) or Conventional Therapy (CT). The RAGT group received 12 training sessions with gait orthosis Lokomat over 6 weeks. The control group received 12 sessions of conventional therapy. Primary outcomes measure were the six-minute walking test (6MWT), the Berg Balance Test (BBT), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and the 10 min walking test (10mWT). Secondary outcomes were self-reported questionnaire on fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), quality of life Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Moreover the subjects performed two functional exercise: the first is the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of knee extensor muscles; the second consists of an isometric contraction of the knee extensors, maintaining a force level of 20%, 50%, or 75% of MVC. Motor unit firing rate analysis has been performed through the analysis of surface EMG signals during the contraction. We analysed the power spectrum in the frequency domain and the root mean-square of the EMG signal. Results: The clinical data were analysed with Wilcoxon test. After 3 and 6 weeks, the RAGT group improved walking endurance (6 MWT) and balance (Berg Scale) (p < 0.05); also gait speed increased without any statistically significant differences. Each patients of RAGT and CT group improved the Quality of life (SF-36) at the end of the training program and three months later (p < 0.05). The balance improved statistically significant in the RAGT group compared with CT group after 3 weeks and at the end of the therapy (p < 0.05). After the treatment, patients were able to deliver an isometric force of the knee extensor greater than the baseline but no statistically significant. EMG signal analysis showed no significant changes. Discussion: Robot assisted-gait training is effective on gait speed, endurance and balance. Conventional and robotic training improve quality of life and this effect is long-lasting. As we did not observed any significant difference of the delivered force neither of the EMG parameters after the treatment, the functional improvement seems not due to a modification in muscle output.",

"Title": "Evaluation of the effectiveness of home based or hospital based calisthenic exercises in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of calisthenic exercises on balance, walking speed, fatigue, quality of life, and psychological status in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed with MS were randomized into two exercise groups (group 1 = hospital-based, group 2 = home-based). Outcome measures including the MS International Quality of Life Scale, 10-meter walking test, Berg Balance Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Inventory were assessed at the baseline and at 12-weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-six participants completed the exercise programme (hospital based = 16, home based = 20). The mean age was 32.83 +/- 3.64 years. The mean duration of disease was 6.97 +/- 3.15 years. Hospital-based and home-based exercise groups had significant improvements in the balance, 10-meter walking test, anxiety, and the quality of life after the 12-week exercise programme. There was a significant improvement in the hospital-based patients in terms of the depression scores. No significant improvement was observed in terms of fatigue in any of the groups. When both groups were compared, the improvement in the balance and depression scores of the hospital-based patients was significantly higher than the home-based patients. CONCLUSIONS: Calisthenic exercises can be easily performed both at home and in hospital setting. In patients with MS, calisthenic exercises performed at home or at the hospital may improve the balance, quality of life, and the functional and psychological status, while no significant effect has been observed on fatigue.",

"Title": "Pilates exercise training vs. physical therapy for improving walking and balance in people with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of a Pilates exercise programme on walking and balance in people with multiple sclerosis and compare this exercise approach to conventional physical therapy sessions. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. SUBJECTS: Forty-five people with multiple sclerosis, 29 females, mean age (SD) was 43.2 (11.6) years; mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (S.D) was 4.3 (1.3). INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 12 weekly training sessions of either Pilates ( n=22) or standardized physical therapy ( n=23) in an outpatient basis. MAIN MEASURES: Spatio-temporal parameters of walking and posturography parameters during static stance. Functional tests included the Time Up and Go Test, 2 and 6-minute walk test, Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance Scale and the Four Square Step Test. In addition, the following self-report forms included the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. RESULTS: At the termination, both groups had significantly increased their walking speed ( P=0.021) and mean step length ( P=0.023). According to the 2-minute and 6-minute walking tests, both groups at the end of the intervention program had increased their walking speed. Mean (SD) increase in the Pilates and physical therapy groups were 39.1 (78.3) and 25.3 (67.2) meters, respectively. There was no effect of group X time in all instrumented and clinical balance and gait measures. CONCLUSIONS: Pilates is a possible treatment option for people with multiple sclerosis in order to improve their walking and balance capabilities. However, this approach does not have any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise may have beneficial effects on both well-being and walking ability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise is shown to be neuroprotective in rodents and may also enhance cognitive function in humans. It may, therefore, be particularly useful for MS patients with pronounced neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of standardized exercise as a therapeutic intervention for progressive MS, in a randomized-controlled pilot trial. METHODS: Patients with progressive MS and moderate disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 4-6) were randomized to one of three exercise interventions (arm ergometry, rowing, bicycle ergometry) for 8-10 weeks or a waitlist control group. We analyzed the drop-out rate as a measure of feasibility. The primary endpoint of the study was aerobic fitness. Secondary endpoints were walking ability, cognitive function as measured by a neuropsychological test battery, depression and fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients completed the trial (10.6% drop-out rate). Significant improvements were seen in aerobic fitness. In addition, exercise improved walking ability, depressive symptoms, fatigue and several domains of cognitive function. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that aerobic training is feasible and could be beneficial for patients with progressive MS. Larger exercise studies are needed to confirm the effect on cognition.

"Title": "Positive impact of regular circuit training on muscle strength, stability, depression and fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients",
"Abstract": "Background: A positive effect of aerobic or resistance training has been described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, only a few papers were dedicated to the use of circuit training in patients with MS. Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the response of MS patients with mild to moderate disability to the circuit training with aerobic activities and the response to the circuit training with aerobic plus resistance exercises. Methods: Fifty MS patients participated in aerobic plus resistance circuit training (AER) or in resistance circuit training (RES), both with frequency of two times a week for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the training programme. Physical assessment includes: muscle strength of lower limbs - knee flexors and extensors measured with a dynamometer, balance assessment with balance master (sensory organization test; SOT), walking tests - timed 25 foot walk test, 4 minute walk test, timed up and go test. Psychological assessment includes: modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), Beck depression inventory (BDI), the short form 36 health survey (SF36). Results: MS patients were randomly allocated to the exercise groups (24 had aerobic resistance circuit training and 26 had resistance circuit training). There were seven men and 63 women, median age 43 years (range 23-68 years), median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.5 (range 1.5-6). Four patients did not complete the study (two from each group) for noncompliance or unrelated injuries. To investigate the relationship between AER and RES circuit training we have performed mixed models analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), EDSS and disease duration. We have shown a significant effect of both types of regular circuit training on the strength of knee flexors (P=0.013), strength of knee extensors (P=0.014), standing stability in SOT test (P=0), reduction of fatigue (P=0.052), reduction of depression (P=0.011). Conclusion: Both types of circuit training (AER and RES) on a regular basis had a significant effect on physical parameters (muscle strength of lower limbs and stability during stance) as well as on psychological parameters (fatigue perception and depression). Both types of circuit training activities were well tolerated by MS patients, regardless of age or disability level. There was no significant difference in outcomes of the two regimens.",

"Title": "Exercising Impacts on Fatigue, Depression, and Paresthesia in Female Patients with Multiple Sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease impacting both body and mind. Typically, patients with MS report fatigue, depression, and paresthesia. Standard treatment consists of immune modulatory medication, though there is growing evidence that exercising programs have a positive influence on fatigue and psychological symptoms such as depression. We tested the hypothesis that, in addition to the standard immune regulatory medication, either yoga or aquatic exercise can ameliorate both fatigue and depression, and we examined whether these interventions also influence paresthesia compared with a nonexercise control condition. METHODS: Fifty-four women with MS (mean age: M = 33.94 yr, SD = 6.92) were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: yoga, aquatic exercise, or nonexercise control. Their existing immune modulatory therapy remained unchanged. Participants completed questionnaires covering symptoms of fatigue, depression, and paresthesia, both at baseline and on completion of the study 8 wk later. RESULTS: Compared with the nonexercise control condition and over time, fatigue, depression, and paresthesia decreased significantly in the yoga and aquatic exercise groups. On study completion, the likelihood of reporting moderate to severe depression was 35-fold higher in the nonexercise control condition than in the intervention conditions (yoga and aquatic exercising values collapsed). CONCLUSION: The pattern of results suggests that for females with MS and treated with standard immune regulatory medication, exercise training programs such as yoga and aquatic exercising positively impact on core symptoms of MS, namely, fatigue, depression, and paresthesia. Exercise training programs should be considered in the future as possible complements to standard treatments.",

"Title": "The effects of robot-assisted gait training in progressive multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Gait and mobility impairments are common in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), leading to reduced quality of life (QoL). Objective: In this randomized controlled study, we tested the effects of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) and compared it to conventional physiotherapy, measuring walking ability, depression, fatigue, and QoL in patients with progressive MS and severe gait disability. Methods: Fifty-two participants (Expanded Disability Status Scale score 6-7) completed the study protocol. They received two sessions/week over 6 weeks of RAGT or conventional walking therapy. Outcome measures were Six-Minute Walk Test, Ten-Meter Walk Test, Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Short Form 36. They were performed pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 months. Results: Walking endurance (p < 0.01) and balance (p < 0.01) were improved among those in the RAGT group. Positive effects on depression in both treatment groups were highlighted. However, only among those in the RAGT group was perceived physical functioning QoL increased. No significant effects on fatigue were found. Conclusion: RAGT is a treatment option in progressive MS patients with severe gait impairments to induce short-lasting effects on mobility and QoL.",

"Title": "Endurance training in MS: short-term immune responses and their relation to cardiorespiratory fitness, health-related quality of life, and fatigue",
"Abstract": "The influences of exercise on cytokine response, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and fatigue are important aspects of MS rehabilitation. Physical exercises performed within these programs are often practiced in water, but the effects of immersion have not been investigated. To investigate the influences of short-term immune responses and cardiorespiratory fitness on HR-QoL and fatigue during 3 weeks endurance training conducted on a cycle-ergometer or an aquatic-bike. Randomized controlled clinical trial in 60 MS patients. HR-QoL, fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness, and short-term immune changes (serum concentrations in response to cardiopulmonary exercise test) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin-6, and the soluble receptor of IL-6 (sIL-6R) were determined at the beginning and end of 3 weeks of training intervention. Subjects performed daily 30 min training at 60 % of their VO2peak. SF-36 total (p = 0.031), physical (p = 0.004), and mental health (p = 0.057) scores show time effects within both groups. Between-group effects were shown for FSMC total (p = 0.040) and motor function score (p = 0.041). MFIS physical fatigue showed time effects (p = 0.008) for both groups. Linear regression models showed relationships between short-term immune responses and cardiorespiratory fitness with HR-QoL and fatigue after the intervention. This study indicates beneficial effects of endurance training independent of the training setting. Short-term immune adaptations and cardiorespiratory fitness have the potential to influence HR-QoL and fatigue in persons with MS. The specific immune responses of immersion to exercise need further clarification.",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial of yoga and exercise in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of yoga and of aerobic exercise on cognitive function, fatigue, mood, and quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Subjects with clinically definite MS and Expanded Disability Status Score less than or equal to 6.0 were randomly assigned to one of three groups lasting 6 months: weekly Iyengar yoga class along with home practice, weekly exercise class using a stationary bicycle along with home exercise, or a waiting-list control group. Outcome assessments performed at baseline and at the end of the 6-month period included a battery of cognitive measures focused on attention, physiologic measures of alertness, Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), and Short Form (SF)-36 health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects were recruited and randomized. Twelve subjects did not finish the 6-month intervention. There were no adverse events related to the intervention. There were no effects from either of the active interventions on either of the primary outcome measures of attention or alertness. Both active interventions produced improvement in secondary measures of fatigue compared to the control group: Energy and Fatigue (Vitality) on the SF-36 and general fatigue on the MFI. There were no clear changes in mood related to yoga or exercise. CONCLUSION: Subjects with MS participating in either a 6-month yoga class or exercise class showed significant improvement in measures of fatigue compared to a waiting-list control group. There was no relative improvement of cognitive function in either of the intervention groups.",

"Title": "The effects of resistance training and physical activities in groups in comparison for the treatment of chronic fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Non-pharmacological rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an important topic. Only little is known about the effects of physical effects on fatigue. Objective: To explore the effects of progressive resistance training (PoRT) with weight machines versus core and stability training in groups (CoaST) using the body weight compared to a waiting group on motor and cognitive fatigue. Methods: A randomized multi-centre 3-arm interventional single blind study. SUBJECTS: 70 individuals with MS (mean age 46.3 years, mean EDSS 3.22). INTERVENTION: The three arms were PoRT, CoaST and waiting group without exercise training. Participants trained 60 minutes per week for an intervention period of 24 weeks. All assessments were held at baseline after 12 and 24 weeks. Mean Outcome Parameters: Neurological conditions were assessed by different questionnaires and tests: FSMC, BDI, SF-36, EDSS and MSFC. Results: At baseline participants of PoRT, CoaST and controlgroups suffer from a moderate fatigue with accentuation of severe motor fatigue and moderate cognitive fatigue. After 12 and 24 weeks of training patients of the CoaST group showed no significant changes of fatigue (mean 64). Patients of the PoRT group showed an amelioration (-5.79) after 24 weeks mainly due to a reduction from 29.45 to 25.53 of cognitive fatigue. The PoRT group showed the highest changes within the first 12 weeks of intervention. The control group showed no changes. Conclusions: Sixty minutes of PoRT showed a decrease of fatigue, particularly in cognitive fatigue. CoaST training showed no effects on fatigue. This indicates that individualized training on weight machines may be an efficient tool for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue. Further trials are required to investigate further training modalities for the therapy of fatigue especially cognitive fatigue and individual rehabilitation strategies.",

"Title": "Sensory integration balance training in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized, controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired sensory integration contributes to balance disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to compare the effects of sensory integration balance training against conventional rehabilitation on balance disorders, the level of balance confidence perceived, quality of life, fatigue, frequency of falls, and sensory integration processing on a large sample of patients with MS. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized, controlled trial involved 80 outpatients with MS (EDSS: 1.5-6.0) and subjective symptoms of balance disorders. The experimental group (n = 39) received specific training to improve central integration of afferent sensory inputs; the control group (n = 41) received conventional rehabilitation (15 treatment sessions of 50 minutes each). Before, after treatment, and at one month post-treatment, patients were evaluated by a blinded rater using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), number of falls and the Sensory Organization Balance Test (SOT). RESULTS: The experimental training program produced greater improvements than the control group training on the BBS (p < 0.001), the FSS (p < 0.002), number of falls (p = 0.002) and SOT (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Specific training to improve central integration of afferent sensory inputs may ameliorate balance disorders in patients with MS. Clinical Trial Registration (NCT01040117).

"Abstract": "Background: Motor imagery and rhythmic auditory stimulation are physiotherapy strategies for walking rehabilitation. Objectives: To investigate the effect of motor imagery combined with rhythmic cueing on walking, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Individuals with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 1.5-4.5 were randomised into one of three groups: 17 minutes of motor imagery, six times per week, for 4 weeks, with music (A) or metronome cues (B), both with verbal cueing, and (C) controls. Primary outcomes were walking speed (Timed 25-Foot Walk) and distance (6-Minute Walk Test). Secondary outcomes were walking perception (Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and QoL (Short Form-36 Health Survey, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, Euroquol-5D-3L Questionnaire). Results: Of the 112 participants randomised, 101 completed the study. Compared to controls, both interventions significantly improved walking speed, distance and perception. Significant improvements in cognitive but not psychosocial fatigue were seen in the intervention groups, and physical fatigue improved only in the music-based group. Both interventions improved QoL; however, music-cued motor imagery was superior at improving health-related QoL. Conclusion: Rhythmic-cued motor imagery improves walking, fatigue and QoL in people with MS, with music-cued motor imagery being more effective.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), additional information on the effectiveness of combining aerobic and resistance training, and yoga is required. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effectiveness of community exercise interventions for people with MS having minimal gait impairment. METHODS: A multi-centred, block-randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71). The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) 29v2 physical component, measured before and after the 10-week intervention. Secondary outcomes were the MSIS 29v2 psychological component, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). RESULTS: The group x time interaction approached significance for the MSIS-29v2 physical component (f = 2.48, p = 0.061) and MFIS total (f = 2.50, p = 0.06), and it was significant for the MFIS physical subscale (f = 4.23, p = 0.006). All three exercise interventions led to a statistically significant improvement on the MSIS-29 psychological component and both the MFIS total and physical subscales, which were greater than the control (p < 0.05). Only the PT-led and FI-led interventions significantly improved the MSIS-29 physical and 6MWT to levels greater than the control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the positive effect of exercise on the physical impact of MS and fatigue. The group nature of the classes may have contributed to the positive effects seen on the psychological impact of MS.",

"Title": "Is it feasible to exercise severely disabled patients with multiple sclerosis?",
"Abstract": "Background: Research on the effects of exercise therapy in severely disabled (EDSS >6.0) patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) is deficient. Objective: To evaluate whether upper body endurance training (ET) is 1) safe and tolerable and 2) can be executed at a sufficient volume and intensity to expectedly induce cardio-vascular adaptations over time. Methods: Eleven PMS patients (6.5=EDSS=8.0) were randomized to either a control group (n = 5,4F/1M, 55.2Ã‚Â±8.2y,169.0Ã‚Â± 10.3cm,84.5Ã‚Â±20.5kg,3SP/2PP, EDSS:7.3Ã‚Â±0.6) or to an intervention group (n = 6,4F/2M, 62.0Ã‚Â±5.8y,172.3Ã‚Â±8.7cm, 71.9Ã‚Â±6.3kg, 5SP/1PP,EDSS:7.0Ã‚Â±0.4). Both groups received a four week inpatient programme with individualized MS rehabilitation and within same period the intervention group completed 10 sessions of upper body ET (six 3 minute intervals at a heart rate corresponding to 65-75% of VO2-peak). All ET sessions were performed using fitness equipment designed for persons with impaired leg function. Primary outcome measures were tolerance to ET and training quality. Before and after the four week intervention period all patients completed VO2-peak testing (incremental arm exercise test performed on a Monark Ergomedic 834E bicycle ergometer), tests of physical function (9 hole peg test , hand grip strength, Box and Block test and 6 minute wheelchair test) and fulfilled questionnaires on depression, disease impact and fatigue (MDI, MSIS-29, FSMC). Results: One patient from the EXE group was excluded from the analysis, because the patient had to be hospitalized during the intervention, giving a drop-out rate of 1/6~17%. No adverse events were recorded. Participants in the EXE group completed on average 9.3Ã‚Â±0.8 sessions of the planned 10 sessions (~96.0Ã‚Â±5%). An average heart rate of 93.9Ã‚Â±9.3beats*min-1 were sustained during the ET sessions corresponding to 91.6Ã‚Â±6.8% of the maximal pre-intervention heart rate. An average Borg score of 14.6Ã‚Â±1.7 were registered during the ET sessions. Four participants in the EXE group showed improved VO2- max, while none of the participants in the CON group showed improvements. Comparison of the changes (EXE: 308Ã‚Â±312ml O2/min vs. CON: 2Ã‚Â±30ml O2/min) in VO2-max showed a tendency towards a groups difference (p = 0.06). When changes in all other measures of physical function and questionnaires were compared no significant group differences were found. Conclusion: ET is feasible and safe in severely disabled patients with MS and ET can probably be performed at sufficient intensity to induce increases in VO2-max.",

"Title": "Exercise Training in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: A Comparison of Recumbent Stepping and Body Weight-Supported Treadmill Training",
"Abstract": "Background: There is evidence of the benefits of exercise training in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, few studies have been conducted in individuals with progressive MS and severe mobility impairment. A potential exercise rehabilitation approach is total-body recumbent stepper training (TBRST). We evaluated the safety and participant-reported experience of TBRST in people with progressive MS and compared the efficacy of TBRST with that of body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) on outcomes of function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods: Twelve participants with progressive MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, 6.0-8.0) were randomized to receive TBRST or BWSTT. Participants completed three weekly sessions (30 minutes) of exercise training for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes included safety assessed as adverse events and patient-reported exercise experience assessed as postexercise response and evaluation of exercise equipment. Secondary outcomes included the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 questionnaire scores. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Safety was confirmed in both exercise groups. Participants reported enjoying both exercise modalities; however, TBRST was reviewed more favorably. Both interventions reduced fatigue and improved HRQOL (P = .05); there were no changes in function. Conclusions: Both TBRST and BWSTT seem to be safe, well tolerated, and enjoyable for participants with progressive MS with severe disability. Both interventions may also be efficacious for reducing fatigue and improving HRQOL. TBRST should be further explored as an exercise rehabilitation tool for patients with progressive MS.",

RESULTS: After training, the Pimax (P<.008) and Pemax (P<.02) increased in the training group. The improvement in Pimax after 10 weeks of training was higher than the improvement in the control group (P<.01) and was maintained 1 month after the training period ended. The training affected neither respiratory function nor the patients' symptoms.

"Abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of a 12-week home walking program on cardiovascular parameters, fatigue perception, and walking distance in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Twelve ambulatory persons with MS, not currently participating in exercise were randomly assigned to control (C) or experimental groups (EX). Pretest data collection included resting HR, BP, fatigue perception (Fatigue Severity Scale), and 6-minute walk test. EX received a home walking program (30 min, 3 x week, x 12 weeks), using a modification of Karvonen's formula to calculate HR range. A HR monitor was used to adjust walking speed. The C group refrained from any regular exercise. Posttest data were collected at week 12 and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U Test. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were noted between groups in any measured parameters; however, walking distance and Physiologic Cost Index did improve in the exercise group. CONCLUSION: No adverse events or increase in fatigue levels related to the exercise intervention were reported in this study. This home walking program may not be of sufficient intensity to elicit significant cardiovascular changes. Abnormal cardiac responses have been documented in this population, which may have affected the results. Clinicians may need to use alternate measures to assess fitness in this population.",

"Title": "Heat sensitive persons with multiple sclerosis are more tolerant to resistance exercise than to endurance exercise",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heat sensitivity (HS) is reported by 58% of all persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), causing symptom exacerbation possibly limiting exercise participation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that (a) a relationship between exercise-induced changes in core-temperature (C(temp)) and changes in symptom intensity exists, and (b) that resistance exercise (RE), as a consequence of a minor increase in core temperature, will induce a lesser worsening of symptoms than endurance exercise (EE) in HS persons with MS. METHODS: On two separate days, 16 HS persons with MS randomly completed a session of RE and EE, or EE and RE, respectively. Testing was conducted pre, post and one hour after exercise and consisted of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scoring (fatigue, spasticity, pain, strength, walking and balance), the 5-time sit-to-stand (5STS), the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and Body Sway. Composite scores describing average subjective symptom intensity (SI) and total number of symptoms (SN) were calculated from VAS scores. RESULTS: C(temp) (0.9+/-0.4degreeC vs 0.3+/-0.1degreeC, p<0.001), SI (1.7+/-1.9 cm vs 0.6+/-1.5 cm, p<0.05) and SN (1.6+/-1.9 vs 0.6+/-2.1, p<0.05) increased significantly more during EE than RE. Changes in C(temp) correlated to changes in SI (r=0.50, p<0.01). No differences were observed in 5STS, MSFC and Body Sway scores after EE when compared to RE. CONCLUSION: An exercise-induced increase in C(temp) is associated with increased number and severity of perceived symptoms in HS persons with MS. Based on these findings it is expected that HS persons with MS do tolerate RE better than EE.",

"Title": "Resistive respiratory muscle training improves respiratory muscle strength, exercise duration and fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Objective: To determine the effects of a 6-week resistive respiratory muscle training (RRMT) program on respiratory muscle strength, exercise duration and fatigue of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Seventeen men and women with MS with mild-to-moderate disability (EDSS <6.5) were randomly assigned to either the RRMT group (n=9) or the placebo control group (n=8). Exclusion criteria were a relapse or steroid use within the past 6 weeks, smoker, wheelchair-bound, breathing/ respiratory illness within past 4 weeks, unable to pedal a stationary bike continuously for 15 minutes or contraindications for exercise. Interventions: A 6-week RRMT program or placebo control (no load) breathing, 3 times/week, 30 minutes/session, on a specially designed device. Resistances, based on initial measures of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, were progressively increased from 30% to 80% over the 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): Maximal inspiratory (PImax) and expiratory (PEmax) pressures were measured using a metabolic cart. Exercise duration was determined by a submaximal endurance test (60%ofmaximal workload) on a cycle ergometer. Perceived fatigue (physical, cognitive, psychosocial and total scores) was assessed using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Results: The RRMT group significantly improved PImax (p=.007), PEmax (p=.013), exercise duration (p=.032), and fatigue levels (p=.009) after the short-term RRMT program, while the placebo control group had significant change in maximal inspiratory pressure (p=.034) only. T-tests were used to determine pre-to-post-test changes. Conclusions: A short-term resistive respiratory muscle training program can improve respiratory muscle strength, exercise duration and perceived fatigue in MS patients with mild-to-moderate disability.",

"Title": "Internet-based home training is capable to improve balance in multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Balance disorders are common in multiple sclerosis. AIM: Aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of an Internet-based home training program (e-Training) to improve balance in patients with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Academic teaching hospital in cooperation with the therapeutic riding center Gut Uttingshof, Bad Mergentheim. POPULATION: Eighteen multiple sclerosis patients (mean EDSS 3,5) took part in the trial. Outcome of patients using e-Training (N.=9) was compared to the outcome of patients receiving hippotherapy (N.=9), which can be considered as an advanced concept for the improvement of balance and postural control in multiple sclerosis. METHODS: After simple random allocation patients received hippotherapy or Internet-based home training (balance, postural control and strength training) twice a week for 12 weeks. Assessments were done before and after the intervention and included static and dynamic balance (primary outcome). Isometric muscle strength of the knee and trunk extension/flexion (dynamometer), walking capacity, fatigue and quality of life served as secondary outcome parameters. RESULTS: Both intervention groups showed comparable and highly significant improvement in static and dynamic balance capacity, no difference was seen between the both intervention groups. However looking at fatigue and quality of life only the group receiving hippotherapy improved significantly. CONCLUSION: Since e-Training shows even comparable effects to hippotherapy to improve balance, we believe that the established Internet-based home training program, specialized on balance and postural control training, is feasible for a balance and strength training in persons with multiple sclerosis. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: We demonstrated that Internet-based home training is possible in patients with multiple sclerosis.",

"Title": "Treadmill training for individuals with multiple sclerosis: a pilot randomised trial",
"Abstract": "This pilot study investigated whether 4 weeks of aerobic treadmill training in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) improved mobility and reduced fatigue. Individuals with MS were recruited to this prospective, randomised controlled trial. Individuals were assessed at baseline, week 7 and 12 with a 10 metre timed walk, a 2 minute walk, the Rivermead Mobility Index, and the Fatigue Severity Scale. After a pre-assessment familiarisation session and a baseline assessment, individuals were randomly allocated to an initial intervention or delayed intervention group. Treadmill training consisted of 4 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise delivered weeks 3-6 in the immediate group and 8-11 in the delayed group. Of the initial 19 recruits, 16 individuals completed the study. There was a significant difference in walking endurance between the delayed and immediate groups at baseline (p<0.05). On reassessment in week 7, decreases in 10 metre walk time were found in both groups, which was significant in the immediate group (p<0.05). The 2 minute walk distance significantly increased in both groups (p<0.05). In the training group, reassessed at week 12 after training ceased, there was a return towards baseline scores. No significant changes in fatigue scores were found. This study showed that in individuals with MS, aerobic treadmill training is feasible and well tolerated. Walking speed and endurance increased following training with no increase in reported fatigue. Detraining occurred in the period following training. A larger randomised clinical trial is warranted.",

"Title": "Influence of sports climbing and yoga on spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Objectives: Spasticity, cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue significantly reduce the quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. To find out whether nonpharmalogical treatment approaches can reduce these symptoms we investigated effects of sports climbing (SC) and yoga on spasticity, cognitive impairment, mood change and fatigue in MS patients. Sports climbing (SC) and yoga are aerobic physical activities comprised a series of stretching techniques, implementation of which demands body control and planning of complex movements. Materials and methods: 20 subjects with relapsing-remitting or progressive MS, 26-50 years of age, with EDSS (less-than or equal to) 6 and EDSS pyramidal functions score (EDSSpyr) > 2 were enrolled in a randomized prospective study. The participants were randomly divided into SC and yoga group. We evaluated spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue before and after both programs, that lasted 10 weeks, with standardized assessment methods. Results: There were no significant improvements in spasticity after SC and yoga. In the SC group we found a 25% reduction (p = 0.046) in EDSSpyr. There were no differences in executive function after the completion of both programs. There was a 17% increase in selective attention performance after yoga (p = 0.005). SC reduced fatigue for 32.5% (p = 0.015), while yoga had no effect. We found no significant impact of SC and yoga on mood. Conclusions: Yoga and SC might improve some of the MS symptoms and should be considered in the future as possible complementary treatments. (copyright) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

"Title": "Balance treatments in subjects with multiple sclerosis: Effects of physical therapy interventions with and without biofeedback and/or forceplate training",
"Abstract": "Objective: Balance disorders are frequently observed in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS), which leads to impaired balance and increased risk of falls. Visual biofeedback and/or forceplate systems are often used for treatment of balance disorders. In this study, we investigated the addition of visual and biofeedback and/or forceplate training in enhancing the effects of other physical therapy interventions on balance in subjects with MS. Design: The study included 20 subjects with MS, according to McDonald Criteria, followed up as outpatients at AISM Rehabilitation Centre. The subjects were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group when the study began. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to assess the effects of TREATMENT and TIME and the interaction TIMETREATMENT. Setting: Subjects followed up as outpatients at AISM Rehabilitation Centre, Genova, Italy. Participants: 20 subjects with clinically definite MS. Interventions: The experimental group trained on the NeroCom Balance Master for 45 minutes every session, twice a week for 5 weeks. The control group received traditional physical therapy for 45 minutes every session, twice a week for 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: All the subjects were evaluated with EDSS, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Berg Balance scale (BERG), Equitest (NeuroCom) -Sensory Organization Test (SOT) and Motor Control Test (MCT) - and Balance Master (NeuroCom). Main outcomes were: MFIS, BERG, SOT, and MCT. Results: After intervention, both groups scored higher on the Berg Balance Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and Sensory Organization Test (Equitest NeuroCom), with a P<.05. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed a greater improvement in the experimental group for the Berg Balance Scale and the Sensory Organization Test. Conclusions: Our results indicate that physical therapy is helpful for improving balance in subjects with MS with an additional effect of biofeedback and/or forceplate training. Biofeedback and/or forceplate training should be a part of multimodal approach to balance disorders treatments in subjects with MS.",

"Title": "The effects of robot-assisted gait training on locomotor function in subjects with multiple sclerosis: A three months follow-up study",
"Abstract": "Introduction Gait disabilities are very common in multiple sclerosis with a negative impact on personal activities and quality of life. It has been shown that human brain is capable of significant modification providing that the quantity (duration and frequency) and quality (task specificity) of rehabilitative interventions are appropriate to facilitate neuroplasticity and motor learning [1]. The aims of this study is to test the effects of robot-assisted gait training in mid-functioning multiple sclerosis subjects on spatiotemporal gait parameters and locomotor function. Materials and methods This is a pilot randomized single blind trial. Multiple sclerosis subjects with no relapse during the last 6 months and gait impairments defined as Expanded Disability Status Scale from 4.5 to 6.5 wereenrolled. Participants have been randomized to robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) or conventional therapy (CT). The experimental group received 12 robot-assisted gait training session over 6 weeks (2 sessions/week). The control group received 12 conventional therapy sessions over 6 weeks (2 sessions/week). Primary outcome measures were spatiotemporal gait parameters obtained with a stereophotogrammetric system with 6 infrared cameras (VICON 460, Vicon Motion System Ltd., UK). Secondary outcome measures included clinical tests as the six-minute walking test (SMWT), the Berg Balance Test (BBT) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). Self-reported questionnaire on motor fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) was submitted. Outcome measures were assessed pre-post-training and after 3 months. Results Twenty subjects were randomized, ten to RAGT and ten to conventional therapy. Three subjects dropped out due to medical conditions. Spatiotemporal gait parameters showed an overall improvement after training in the RAGT group: walking speed improved from 0.57Ã‚Â±0.24 to 0.65Ã‚Â±0.21 (p < 0.0001) and 0.6Ã‚Â±0.23 at 3 months (Fig. 1); cadence improved after treatment from 76.9Ã‚Â±24.5 to 83.1Ã‚Â±21.1 (p < 0.0001) and was sustained (80.1Ã‚Â±21.1); double support was reduced from 0.80Ã‚Â±0.67 to 0.60Ã‚Â±0.51 (p < 0.0001) and 0.64Ã‚Â±0.57 at 3 months. There were no differences in walking speed and cadence in the conventional therapy group. Walking endurance was improved by an average of 40.2m in the RAGT group (p < 0.01), compared to ?0.1min the CT group after training. At 3 months RAGT group still improved in walking endurance by an average of 53.9m(p < 0.01) in (Figure presented) the SMWT. Better performance was also noted in the TUG and BBT scores in the RAGT group. Subjects also reported a reduced motor fatigue after training. Discussion Robot-assisted gait training seems to be effective in restoring walking competency in mid-functioning multiple sclerosis subjects. These results were partially retained at 3 months follow-up.",

"Abstract": "[Purpose] The aim of this study was to determine the effects of clinical Pilates in multiple sclerosis patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty multiple sclerosis patients were enrolled in this study. The participants were divided into two groups as the clinical Pilates and control groups. Cognition (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite), balance (Berg Balance Scale), physical performance (timed performance tests, Timed up and go test), tiredness (Modified Fatigue Impact scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire) were measured before and after treatment in all participants. [Results] There were statistically significant differences in balance, timed performance, tiredness and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite tests between before and after treatment in the clinical Pilates group. We also found significant differences in timed performance tests, the Timed up and go test and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite between before and after treatment in the control group. According to the difference analyses, there were significant differences in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire scores between the two groups in favor of the clinical Pilates group. There were statistically significant clinical differences in favor of the clinical Pilates group in comparison of measurements between the groups. Clinical Pilates improved cognitive functions and quality of life compared with traditional exercise. [Conclusion] In Multiple Sclerosis treatment, clinical Pilates should be used as a holistic approach by physical therapists.",

"Title": "Effects of Eight-week Resistance Training Program in Men With Multiple Sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness and fatigue contribute to the reduction of daily activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Therapeutic strategies to promote improvements in muscle strength and endurance are limited in individuals with MS. Some evidence showed that exercise may improve and affect different aspects of the disease including quality of life, fatigue, motor and cognitive functions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of resistance training of moderate to high intensity on motor function, muscle strength, balance and perceived disability in male patients with multiple sclerosis compared to a control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 male patients with MS (mean Ã‚Â± SD, age: 34.05 Ã‚Â± 7.8 y; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.94 Ã‚Â± 1.5) were recruited and randomized either to the exercise (E) or control group (C). Group E participated in a three-time weekly individualized progressive resistance-training program (both upper and lower extremities) for eight weeks, while group C was advised not to change their physical activity habits. All initial measures (including EDSS, balance, muscle strength, and functional mobility) were re-evaluated at the end of the program. RESULTS: Two patients of group E left the program. The other eight subjects completed the program with no MS-related exacerbations/complications. There was a significant change in 2 of 3 aspects of ambulatory function [Three minutes step test (P = 0.001), Timed Up and Go test (P = 0.009)], muscle strength (P = 0.000), and EDSS (P = 0.014). Comparing the two groups, we did not observe any significant change in \"Balance\" (P = 0.407). CONCLUSIONS: The resistance training of moderate to high intensity was well-tolerated in MS patients and may be an effective intervention for improving muscle strength, functional ability and EDSS-based disease severity.",

"Title": "Effects of high-intensity resistance training on strength, mobility, balance, and fatigue in individuals with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically induced work (RENEW) has been shown to be associated with improvements in strength, mobility, and balance in multiple clinical populations. However, RENEW has not been reported for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Nineteen individuals with MS (8 men, 11 women; age mean = 49 Ã‚Â± 11 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] mean = 5.2 Ã‚Â± 0.9) were randomized into either standard exercise (STAND) or standard exercise and RENEW training (RENEW) for 3Ãƒâ€”/week for 12 weeks. Outcome measures were lower extremity strength (hip/knee flexion and extension, ankle plantar and dorsiflexion, and the sum of these individual values [sum strength]); Timed Up and Go (TUG), 10-m walk, self-selected pace (TMWSS) and maximal-pace (TMWMP), stair ascent (S-A) and descent (S-D) and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: No significant time effects or interactions were observed for strength, TUG, TMWSS, TMWMP, or 6MWT. However, the mean difference in sum strength in the RENEW group was 38.60 (representing a 15% increase) compared to the sum strength observed in the STAND group with a mean difference of 5.58 (a 2% increase). A significant interaction was observed for S-A, S-D, and BBS as the STAND group improved whereas the RENEW group did not improve in these measures. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to results in other populations, the addition of eccentric training to standard exercises did not result in significantly greater lower extremity strength gains in this group of individuals with MS. Further this training was not as effective as standard exercise alone in improving balance or the ability to ascend and descend stairs. Following data collection, reassessment of required sample size indicates we were likely underpowered to detect strength differences between groups.",

"Title": "Robot-assisted vs. sensory integration training in treating gait and balance dysfunctions in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Extensive research on both healthy subjects and patients with central nervous damage has elucidated a crucial role of postural adjustment reactions and central sensory integration processes in generating and shaping\" locomotor function, respectively. Whether robotic-assisted gait devices might improve these functions in Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is not fully investigated in literature. Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of end-effector robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) and sensory integration balance training (SIBT) in improving walking and balance performance in patients with MS. Methods: Twenty-two patients with MS (EDSS: 1.5-6.5) were randomly assigned to two groups. The RAGT group (n = 12) underwent end-effector system training. The SIBT group (n = 10) underwent specific balance exercises. Each patient received twelve 50-min treatment sessions (2 days/week). A blinded rater evaluated patients before and after treatment as well as 1 month post treatment. Primary outcomes were walking speed and Berg Balance Scale. Secondary outcomes were the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Sensory Organization Balance Test, Stabilometric Assessment, Fatigue Severity Scale, cadence, step length, single and double support time, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54. Results: Between groups comparisons showed no significant differences on primary and secondary outcome measures over time. Within group comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups on the Berg Balance Scale (P = 0.001). Changes approaching significance were found on gait speed (P = 0.07) only in the RAGT group. Significant changes in balance task-related domains during standing and walking conditions were found in the SIBT group. Conclusion: Balance disorders in patients with MS may be ameliorated by RAGT and by SIBT. Ã‚Â© 2014 Gandolfi, Geroin, Picelli, Munari, Waldner, Tamburin, Marchioretto and Smania.",

"Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility and preliminary effects of a high-intensity rehabilitative task-oriented circuit training (TOCT) in a sample of multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects on walking competency, mobility, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: 24 MS subjects (EDSS 4.89 +/- 0.54, 17 female and 7 male, 52.58 +/- 11.21 years, MS duration 15.21 +/- 8.68 years) have been enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: (i) experimental group received 10 TOCT sessions over 2 weeks (2 hours/each session) followed by a 3 months home exercise program, whereas control group did not receive any specific rehabilitation intervention. A feasibility patient-reported questionnaire was administered after TOCT. Functional outcome measures were: walking endurance (Six Minute Walk Test), gait speed (10 Meter Walk Test), mobility (Timed Up and Go test) and balance (Dynamic Gait Index). Furthermore, self-reported questionnaire of motor fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), walking ability (Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12) and health-related quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29) were included. Subjects' assessments were delivered at baseline (T0), after TOCT (T1) and 3 months of home-based exercise program (T2). Results: After TOCT subjects reported a positive global rating on the received treatment. At 3 months, we found a 58.33% of adherence to the home-exercise program. After TOCT, walking ability and health-related quality of life were improved (p < 0.05) with minor retention after 3 months. The control group showed no significant changes in any variables. Conclusions: This two weeks high-intensity task-oriented circuit class training followed by a three months home-based exercise program seems feasible and safe in MS people with moderate mobility impairments; moreover it might improve walking abilities.

"Title": "The Effect of Group Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction and Consciousness Yoga Program on Quality of Life and Fatigue Severity in Patients with MS",
"Abstract": "Introduction: The chronic nature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), have can leave devastating effects on quality of life and fatigue. The present research aimed to study the effect of group Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and conscious yoga program on the quality of life and fatigue severity among patients with MS. Methods: This study was quasi-experimental with intervention and control groups. The statistical population included all members to MS Society of Tehran Province, 24 of whom diagnosed with MS were selected as the sample based on the inclusion criteria. The subjects were randomly assigned into the test group (12 patients) and the control group (12 patients). MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were used for data collection. Subjects in the test group underwent a MBSR and conscious yoga program in 8 two-hour sessions. The data were analyzed using the SPSS ver.13 software. Results: The study findings showed that there was a significant difference between subjects in the experimental and control groups in terms of mean score of some subscales of quality of life including physical health, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, energy, emotional well-being, health distress, health perception, and satisfaction with sexual function, overall quality of life, and fatigue severity. Conclusion: The results show that the program is effective in reduction of fatigue severity and improving some subscales of quality of life in MS patients. Hence, this supportive method can be used as an effective way for improving quality of life and relieving fatigue in MS patients.",

"Title": "Intensity of treadmill walking exercise on acute mood symptoms in persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: An acute bout of moderate-intensity treadmill walking exercise has previously been associated with improvements in overall mood disturbance and vigor, without worsening fatigue, among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).This study examined the effects of light-, moderate-, and high-intensity bouts of treadmill walking exercise on immediate and delayed mood states in MS. DESIGN: This was a within-subjects, randomized, and counter-balanced study. METHODS: 23 women and 1 man with MS undertook 20-minute bouts of light-, moderate-, and high-intensity treadmill walking, and seated quiet rest. Participants completed the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after each condition. Total mood disturbance (TMD) and six subscales of the POMS were analyzed using 2-way, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: There was a significant condition-by-time interaction on TMD scores ([Formula: see text]) and vigor scores ([Formula: see text]). The moderate-intensity treadmill walking yielded the largest improvements in TMD and vigor immediately post-condition (p?<?.05). These improvements were no longer significant at 45 minutes post-condition (p?>?.05). CONCLUSION: TMD and vigor improved immediately after moderate-intensity walking, but the changes dissipated over time. Fatigue did not worsen after any of the walking conditions. These results indicate that an acute bout of moderate-intensity walking may help with mood management in persons with MS, without worsening fatigue.",

"Title": "Effects of a short-term exercise training program on aerobic fitness, fatigue, health perception and activity level of subjects with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients of an inpatient rehabilitation program have been randomly assigned to an exercise training (MS-ET) or nontraining group (MS-NI). Before and after 4 weeks of aerobic exercise training, a graded maximal exercise test with measurement of gas exchange and a lung function test was administered to all 26 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Activity level, fatigue and health perception were measured by means of questionnaires. Twenty-six healthy persons served as control group and were matched in respect of age, gender and activity level. Training intervention consisted of 5x30 min sessions per week of bicycle exercise with individualised intensity. Compared with baseline, the MS training group demonstrated a significant rightward placement of the aerobic threshold (AT) (VO2+13%; work rate [WR])+11%), an improvement of health perception (vitality+46%; social interaction+36%), an increase of activity level (+17%) and a tendency to less fatigue. No changes were observed for the MS-NI group and the control groups. Maximal aerobic capacity and lung function were not changed by either training or nontraining in all four groups. Overall compliance to the training program was quite low (65%), whereas incidence of symptom exacerbation by physical activity has been lower than expected (6%).",

"Title": "Depression, fatigue, and health-related quality of life among people with advanced multiple sclerosis: results from an exploratory telerehabilitation study",
"Abstract": "This study reports on secondary data, depression, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), collected on people with advanced multiple sclerosis (MS) as part of a larger study of the impact of a telerehabilitation intervention on people with severe mobility impairment. People with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) (n=111) and the prevention of pressure sores were the primary group of interest of the project. The focus here is on data collected from people with advanced MS (n=27), who were included as an exploratory cohort, as they experience increased risk of pressure ulcer development as their level of mobility declines. The study consisted of a nine-week intervention with three randomized groups: video, telephone, and standard care. Aside from information on pressure sores, data were also collected on fatigue, depression, and HRQOL for a two-year follow-up period. For the video group HRQOL scores trended higher and fatigue and depression scores lower for 24 months. Fatigue scores were significantly lower for the video group at month six, 12, and 18. In the sample overall, fatigue symptoms were far more prominent than depressive symptoms and affected 100% higher rates of depression than women. At baseline, controlling for Extended Disability Status Score (EDSS), depression and fatigue were correlated. However, contrary to indications from previous cross-sectional studies, no consistent relationship was observed over time between the two. Telerehabilitation interventions for people with advanced MS warrant further investigation. Findings here suggest that such interventions may be beneficial, although the results need affirmation through larger samples. In addition, the higher prevalence of male depression merits serious attention.",

"Title": "Effects of Intermittent Versus Continuous Walking on Distance Walked and Fatigue in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Crossover Trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fatigue is a common, disabling symptom experienced by persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Evidence shows that intermittent exercise is associated in improved performance and negligible fatigue. The purpose of this study was to examine whether subjects with MS walk greater distances with less fatigue under intermittent (INT) or continuous (CONT) walking condition. METHODS: Twenty-seven subjects with MS (median Extended Disability Severity Scale 3.5, interquartile range 1.6) walked in the CONT (ie, 6 uninterrupted minutes) and INT (ie, three 2-minute walking bouts) conditions in a randomized crossover. Distance was measured for the entire 6-minute walking period and each 2-minute increment. Fatigue was measured as the difference in a visual analog scale of fatigue (DELTAVAS-F) immediately preceding and following each trial. RESULTS: Participants walked greater distances in the INT condition compared to the CONT condition (P = 0.005). There was a significant interaction of walking condition and time (P < 0.001), indicating that the distances walked in the INT condition changed across time. DELTAVAS-F was significantly lower in the INT condition than in the CONT condition (P = 0.036). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Subjects with MS walked farther, and with less fatigue, when walking intermittently rather than continuously. Persons with MS may be able to tolerate a greater dose of walking training if the walking bouts are intermittent. Further study to determine the benefits of a walking exercise program using intermittent walking is recommended.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A103).",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial of exercise interventions to improve sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in individuals with multiple sclerosis: A pilot study",
"Abstract": "Background: Nearly 70% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience sleep disturbances. Increasing physical activity in people with MS has been shown to produce a moderate improvement in sleep quality, and exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality in non-neurologically impaired adults. Objective: The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial study was to examine the effect of two exercise interventions on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in individuals with MS. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals with relapsingÃ¢â‚¬â€œremitting or secondary progressive MS were randomized into one of two 12-week exercise interventions: a supervised, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (AE) program or an unsupervised, low-intensity walking and stretching (WS) program. Only individuals who were = 70% compliant with the programs were included in analysis (n = 12 AE; n = 10 WS). Results: Both groups demonstrated a moderate improvement in sleep quality, although only the improvement by the WS group was statistically significant. Only the AE group demonstrated a significant improvement in daytime sleepiness. Change in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness was not correlated with disease severity or with change in cardiovascular fitness, depression, or fatigue. Conclusion: The mechanisms for improvement in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness need further investigation, but may be due to introduction of zeitgebers to improve circadian rhythm.",

"Title": "Long-term benefits of exercising on quality of life and fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients with mild disability: a pilot study",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if exercise benefits patients with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS: Participants exercised at home and also attended exercise classes held in a hospital physiotherapy gym. SUBJECTS: Thirty patients, diagnosed and independently mobile, were recruited in the Dublin area. INTERVENTION: For three months, classes were held twice-weekly and participants exercised independently once-weekly. The control group was monitored monthly and management remained unchanged. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements were taken at baseline, three and six months. The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) were used to measure fatigue and quality of life (QOL). Heart rate (HR) and the Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were recorded during an incremental exercise test. The change from baseline scores between groups was compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants completed the programme (n = 12 in each group). Based on the change in scores at three months, the exercise group had significantly greater improvements in exercise capacity (HR: -14 [-18.5, -2.5] versus 0.5 [-4, 5.5], P= 0.009), QOL (FAMS: 23 [9.5, 42.5] versus -3.5 [-16, 5], P=0.006) and fatigue (MFIS: -13 [-20, -3] versus 1 [-4, 4.5], P=0.02). At six months, the difference in change scores remained significant for FAMS (19 [14, 31] versus -4.5 [-25, 8], P=0.002) and MFIS (-8.5 [-19.5, -1] versus 0.5 [-2.5, 6.5], P=0.02) only. CONCLUSIONS: A three-month exercise programme improved participants' exercise capacity, QOL and fatigue, with the improvements in QOL and fatigue lasting beyond the programme.",

"Title": "Effect of treadmill training on fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a pilot study",
"Abstract": "People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) tend to be less physically active than the general population. Limited physical activity increases fatigue, possibly affecting other functions such as balance. Treadmill training is a promising method to ameliorate these symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of treadmill training on fatigue and balance. Thirty PwMS were recruited; the mean age was 47.6 (SD 9.2). The median EDSS score was 5.5 (range 3-6.5). Individuals were randomized into a control group receiving 12 sessions of conventional therapy and an experimental group receiving conventional therapy including 15 min of treadmill training. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), the Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Berg Balance Scale were assessed before and after rehabilitation. Despite a low HR (107 beats/min), the RPE score was high (15.8) at baseline assessment. In the experimental group, RPE decreased significantly to 12.8 (P=0.04) after training. Treadmill training also had a positive effect on HR, but no changes in the Fatigue Severity Scale and balance were observed. In conclusion, PwMS showed a high level of exertion before treatment. Treadmill training was effective in reducing the level of perceived fatigue, with no impact on balance.",

"Title": "Telerehabilitation in multiple sclerosis: Results of a randomized, 3-arm, rater blinded, feasibility and efficacy pilot study; patient-reported outcomes report",
"Abstract": "Background: MS commonly results in physical and cognitive disability. Functional improvement of established physical deficits can be achieved through rehabilitation methods to include physical therapy (PT). Access to specialized rehabilitation services is limited due to a variety of factors including availability, geographical distance, mobility limitations, transportation difficulties, and financial constraints. Telecommunication technology offers the capacity to supervise and direct a PT program remotely through audio and visual real-time communication. Objectives: Demonstrate the feasibility of a tele-health rehabilitation program in individuals with ambulatory deficits secondary to MS and to evaluate its efficacy when compared to conventional physical therapy. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, three-arm, evaluator blinded, 8-week study. Thirty individuals were included (female 69%, mean age 54.7 years, RMS 60%. SPMS 23%, PPMS 17%, mean EDSS 4.3). A home-based exercise program (HEP) was performed unsupervised 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Interventions were as follows: Group 1- HEP alone; Group 2- HEP plus remote PT supervised via audio and visual real-time telecommunication 2-3 times per week; Group 3- HEP plus in-person PT at the medical facility 2-3 times per week. Patient-reported outcomes and gait and balance assessments (reported separately) were performed. Results: Patient-reported outcomes showed improvement from baseline in the Modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS) for groups 2 (p=0.05) and 3 (p=0.01) and SF36-mental (SF36m) for groups 2 (p=0.04) and 3 (p=0.01). Groups 2 and 3 were comparatively equivalent in SF36m p=0.06, balance confidence p=0.47, MFIS p=0.37, and self-efficacy p=0.79. Group 3 was better than groups 1 and 2 only in the SF36-physical. One participant dropped out due to an MS relapse. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation is a convenient and practical method to perform PT in MS individuals and is overall equivalent to conventional in-person PT as measured by patient reported outcomes of fatigue, confidence and self-efficacy. Gait and balance outcomes were also favorable and are presented separately. Telerehabilitation should be researched further and used more extensively as a mean to improve function and quality of life in MS.",

"Title": "Resistance Training for Muscle Weakness in Multiple Sclerosis: Direct Versus Contralateral Approach in Individuals With Ankle Dorsiflexors' Disparity in Strength",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of contralateral strength training (CST) and direct strength training of the more affected ankle dorsiflexors on muscle performance and clinical functional outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibiting interlimb strength asymmetry. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (N=30) and mild-to-moderate disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score <=6) presenting with ankle dorsiflexors' strength disparity. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to a CST (n=15) or direct strength training (n=15) group performing 6 weeks of maximal intensity strength training of the less or more affected dorsiflexors, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximal strength, endurance to fatigue, and mobility outcomes were assessed before, at the intervention end, and at 12-week follow-up. Strength and fatigue parameters were measured after 3 weeks of training (midintervention). RESULTS: In the more affected limb of both groups, pre- to postintervention significant increases in maximal strength (P<=.006) and fatigue endurance (P<=.04) were detected along with consistent retention of these improvements at follow-up (P<=.04). At midintervention, the direct strength training group showed significant improvements (P<=.002), with no further increase at postintervention, despite training continuation. Conversely, the CST group showed nonsignificant strength gains, increasing to significance at postintervention (P<=.003). In both groups, significant pre- to postintervention improvements in mobility outcomes (P<=.03), not retained at follow-up, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: After 6 weeks of training, CST proved as effective as direct strength training in enhancing performance of the more affected limb with a different time course, which may have practical implications in management of severely weakened limbs where direct strength training is not initially possible.",

"Title": "Mii-vitaliSe: a pilot randomised controlled trial of a home gaming system (Nintendo Wii) to increase activity levels, vitality and well-being in people with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: While the health and well-being benefits of physical activity are recognised, people with multiple sclerosis (MS) often face greater barriers than the general population. The Nintendo Wii potentially offers a fun, convenient way of overcoming some of these. The aim was to test the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Mii-vitaliSe; a home-based, physiotherapist-supported Nintendo Wii intervention. DESIGN: A single-centre wait-list randomised controlled study. SETTING: MS service in secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory, relatively inactive people with clinically confirmed MS. INTERVENTION: Thirty participants were randomised to receive Mii-vitaliSe either immediately (for 12 months) or after a 6-month wait (for 6 months). Mii-vitaliSe consisted of two supervised Nintendo Wii familiarisation sessions in the hospital followed by home use (Wii Sports, Sports Resort and Fit Plus software) with physiotherapist support and personalised resources. OUTCOMES: Included self-reported physical activity levels, quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, fatigue and assessments of balance, gait, mobility and hand dexterity at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Interviews (n=25) explored participants' experiences and, at study end, the two Mii-vitaliSe facilitators' experiences of intervention delivery (main qualitative findings reported separately). RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 49.3 (8.7) years, 90% female, with 47% diagnosed with MS <6 years ago and 60% new to active gaming. The recruitment rate was 31% (95% CI 20% to 44%). Outcome data were available for 29 (97%) at 6 months and 28 (93%) at 12 months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Qualitative data indicated that Mii-vitaliSe was well-received. Mean Wii use across both groups over the initial 6-month intervention period was twice a week for 27?min/day. Mean cost of delivering Mii-vitaliSe was Ã‚Â£684 per person. DISCUSSION: Mii-vitaliSe appears acceptable and a future trial feasible and warranted. These findings will inform its design.

"Title": "Fatigue, mood and quality of life improve in MS patients after progressive resistance training",
"Abstract": "Fatigue occurs in the majority of multiple sclerosis patients and therapeutic possibilities are few. Fatigue, mood and quality of life were studied in patients with multiple sclerosis following progressive resistance training leading to improvement of muscular strength and functional capacity. Fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS), mood (Major Depression Inventory, MDI) and quality of life (physical and mental component scores, PCS and MCS, of SF36) were scored at start, end and follow-up of a randomized controlled clinical trial of 12 weeks of progressive resistance training in moderately disabled (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS: 3-5.5) multiple sclerosis patients including a Control group (n = 15) and an Exercise group (n = 16). Fatigue (FSS > 4) was present in all patients. Scores of FSS, MDI, PCS-SF36 and MCS-SF36 were comparable at start of study in the two groups. Fatigue improved during exercise by -0.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.4 to 0.4) a.u. vs. 0.1 (95% CI -0.4 to 0.6) a.u. in controls (p = 0.04), mood improved by -2.4 (95% CI -4.1 to 0.7) a.u. vs. 1.1 (-1.2 to 3.4) a.u. in controls (p = 0.01) and quality of life (PCS-SF36) improved by 3.5 (95% CI 1.4-5.7) a.u. vs. -1.0 (95% CI -3.4-1.4) a.u. in controls (p = 0.01). The beneficial effect of progressive resistance training on all scores was maintained at follow-up after further 12 weeks. Fatigue, mood and quality of life all improved following progressive resistance training, the beneficial effect being maintained for at least 12 weeks after end of intervention.",

"Title": "Comparison of the effect of 8 weeks aerobic and yoga training on ambulatory function, fatigue and mood status in MS patients",
"Abstract": "Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system that results in many symptoms including mobility limitation and fatigue. Patients and Methods: Thirty-one MS patients, all female with mean of age of 36.75 years and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) of 1.0 to 4.0 were recruited. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: treadmill training, yoga or control groups. Treadmill training and yoga practice consisted of 8 weeks (24 sessions, thrice weekly). The control group followed their own routine treatment program. Balance, speed and endurance of walking, fatigue, depression and anxiety were measured by Berg Balance scores, time for 10m walk and distance for a two minute walk, Fatigue Severity Scale (FFS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively. Results: Comparison of results have shown that pre- and post-interventions produced significant improvements in the balance score, walking endurance, FFS score, BDI score and BAI score in the treadmill training group and yoga group. However, 10m walk time decreased in the treadmill training group but did not show any clear change in the yoga group. Moreover, the analysis showed significant differences between the treadmill training group and yoga group for BAI score. Conclusions: These results suggest that treadmill training and yoga practice improved ambulatory function, fatigue and mood status in the individuals with mild to moderate MS.

"Title": "Effect of aquatic exercise training on fatigue and health-related quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of aquatic exercise training on fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in women with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, 4-week and 8-week follow-up. SETTING: Referral center of a multiple sclerosis society. PARTICIPANTS: Women (N=32) diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (mean age Ã‚Â± SD, 32.6Ã‚Â±8.0y) were recruited into this study. After undergoing baseline testing by a neurologist, participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention (aquatic exercise) or a control group. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of 8 weeks supervised aquatic exercise in a swimming pool (3 times a week, each session lasting 60min). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, fatigue and HRQOL were assessed by a blind assessor using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 questionnaire, respectively. A mixed-model approach to repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to detect within- and between-subject effects. RESULTS: Findings are based on 21 patients (10 from the exercise group and 11 from the control group) who had data available on outcomes. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at the baseline. Patients in the aquatic exercise group showed significant improvements in fatigue and subscores of HRQOL after 4 and 8 weeks compared with the control group. Results obtained from the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with those of per-protocol analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that aquatic exercise training can effectively improve fatigue and HRQOL of patients with MS and should be considered in the management of this relatively common public health problem.",

"Abstract": "Objective: To assess the effects of an 8-week aquatic exercise training program on functional capacity, balance, and perceptions of fatigue in women with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Randomized controlled design. Setting: Referral center of an MS society. Participants: Women (N=32; mean age Ã‚Â± SD, 36.4Ã‚Â±8.2y) with diagnosed relapsing-remitting MS. After undergoing baseline testing by a neurologist, participants were allocated to either an intervention (aquatic training program, n=17) or a control group (n=15). Interventions: The intervention consisted of an 8-week aquatic training program (3 supervised training sessions per week; session duration, 45-60min; 50%-75% estimated maximum heart rate). Main Outcome Measures: Six-minute walk test (6-MWT), balance (Berg Balance Scale [BBS]), and perceptions of fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale; [MFIS]) at baseline and after the 8-week intervention. Differences over time between the experimental and control groups were assessed by a 2Ãƒâ€”2 (group by time) repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Thirty-two women completed the 8-week aquatic training intervention (experimental group, n=17; control group, n=15). All outcome measures improved in the experimental group: 6-MWT performance (pretest mean Ã‚Â± SD, 451Ã‚Â±58m; posttest mean Ã‚Â± SD, 503Ã‚Â±57m; P<.001); BBS (pretest mean Ã‚Â± SD, 53.59Ã‚Â±1.70; posttest mean Ã‚Â± SD, 55.18Ã‚Â±1.18; P<.001), and MFIS (pretest mean Ã‚Â± SD, 43.1Ã‚Â±14.6; posttest mean Ã‚Â± SD, 32.8Ã‚Â±5.9; P<.01). A significant group-by-time interaction was evident between the experimental and control groups for 6-MWT (P<.001, partial eta(2) [?(p)(2)]=.551), BBS (P<.001, ?(p)(2)=.423), and MFIS (P<.001, ?(p)(2)=.679).

"Title": "Tailored balance exercises on people with multiple sclerosis: A pilot randomized, controlled study",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Altered integration of signals from visual (VIS), somatosensory (PROP) and vestibular system (VEST) lead to balance control impairments affecting the daily living activities of patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). As a consequence, tailored interventions could be crucial in improving efficacy of balance rehabilitation treatments. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to assess the efficacy of tailored rehabilitation treatments for balance disorders based on visual, somatosensory and vestibular deficits versus traditional rehabilitation exercises. METHODS: Thirty-two PwMS were assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the composite score (CS) obtained by computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) test and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Based on CDP analysis, prevalent VIS, PROP or VEST deficits were identified and patients randomly allocated to a personalized (PRG) or traditional (TRG) rehabilitation group. RESULTS: BBS score showed a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment scores of 6.3 and 2.0 points respectively for PRG and TRG. CS showed a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment scores of 16.6 and 7.6 points respectively for PRG and TRG. No interaction effect was found for MFIS score. CONCLUSIONS: BBS and CS showed changes in the PRG group that met clinical relevant difference, underlining that tailored rehabilitation interventions based on patient-specific sensory system impairment could improve balance and postural control in PwMS.

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish the effects of a 12-week, community-based group exercise intervention for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Randomized controlled pilot trial. SETTING: Two community leisure centres. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two participants with multiple sclerosis randomized into intervention or control groups. INTERVENTION: The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises. The control group received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An assessor blinded to group allocation assessed participants at baseline, after eight weeks and after 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, secondary outcomes assessed walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment. RESULTS: The intervention made no statistically significant difference to the results of participants' 25-foot walk time. However the intervention led to many improvements. In the intervention group levels of physical activity improved statistically between baseline and week 8 (P < 0.001) and baseline and week 12 (P = 0.005). Balance confidence results showed a significant difference between baseline and week 12 (P = 0.013). Good effect sizes were found for dynamic balance (d = 0.80), leg strength (d = 1.33), activity levels (d = 1.05) and perceived balance (d = 0.94). CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that community-based group exercise classes are a feasible option for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis, and offer benefits such as improved physical activity levels, balance and leg strength.",

"Title": "Uphill and Downhill Walking in Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various exercise protocols have been recommended for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated the effects of uphill and downhill walking exercise on mobility, functional activities, and muscle strength in MS patients. METHODS: Thirty-four MS patients were randomly allocated to either the downhill or uphill treadmill walking group for 12 sessions (3 times/wk) of 30 minutes' walking on a 10% negative slope (n = 17) or a 10% positive slope (n = 17), respectively. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention and after 4-week follow-up and included fatigue by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale; mobility by Modified Rivermead Mobility Index; disability by Guy's Neurological Disability Scale; functional activities by 2-Minute Walk Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk test, and Timed Up and Go test; balance indices by Biodex Balance System; and quadriceps and hamstring isometric muscles by torque of left and right knee joints. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to investigate the intervention effects on the measurements. RESULTS: After the intervention, significant improvement was found in the downhill group versus the uphill group in terms of fatigue, mobility, and disability indices; functional activities; balance indices; and quadriceps isometric torque (P < .05). The results were stable at 4-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Downhill walking on a treadmill may improve muscle performance, functional activity, and balance control in MS patients. These findings support the idea of using eccentric exercise training in MS rehabilitation protocols.",

"Title": "Effectiveness of balance disorders rehabiliation treatments in multiple sclerosis subjects: A pilot randomized control trial assessing the wii balance board gaming system",
"Abstract": "Objective: Balance disorders are frequently observed in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) leading to impaired balance and increased risk of falls. New rehabilitation approaches are crucial to improve the efficacy of interventions and to stimulate subjects' attention during the rehabilitation treatment. Aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of balance disorder rehabilitation in MS subjects with a portable and widely available force platform (Wii Balance Board) versus a traditional rehabilitation program. Design: Randomized control trial. MS subjects with balance disorders were selected and randomized into 2 groups: Wii Balance Board group - W group and Control group - C group. All subjects were evaluated with EDSS, Ambulation Index (AI), Berg Balance Scale (BERG), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), stabilometric recording with open eyes (STABOE) and closed eyes (STABCE) at T0 (begin of rehabilitation program) and at T1 (end of rehabilitation program). Setting: Clinical evaluation and rehabilitation treatment were performed in AISM rehabilitation centre for MS outpatients. Participants: 36 MS subjects, mean age 43.58Ã‚Â± 12.46 years, mean EDSS 4.17Ã‚Â± 1.61. Interventions: All participants received a rehabilitation treatment (12 sessions, 60 minutes each) with a standardized protocol for the C group and a Wii Balance Board protocol for W group. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was Berg balance scale, secondary outcomes were Ambulation Index, MFIS, STABOE and STABCE. Results: For W group data showed statistically significant differences between T0 and T1 for all outcomes considered in the study. In particular AI, MFIS and BERG showed a P<.001. STABOE and STABCE showed a P<.05. For C group data showed statistically significant differences between T0 and T1 for AI and MFIS (P<.05), whereas non-statistically significant differences were found for BERG, STABOE, and STABCE. Conclusions: Balance rehabilitation with a portable, widely used, force platform appeared to be a useful tool in improving balance skills in subjects with MS. The results of this study will serve as the basis for a larger trial.",

"Title": "Fatigue and quality of life of women with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled clinical trial",
"Abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of aquatic exercise on fatigue and the quality of life in women with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out in a multiple sclerosis clinic in Iran, where 37 outpatient women with MS were randomized into an exercise group (N.=18) and a control group (N.=19). In the exercise group, aquatic exercise was performed for 45 minutes, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The control group did not receive any interventions (aquatic exercise) and were asked to maintain their normal treatments. The severity and perception of fatigue and quality of life (QoL) were measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and Multicultural Quality of Life Index (MQLIM) questionnaires. RESULTS: The repeated measure ANOVA demonstrated significant effects of aquatic exercise on the changes in the scores of physical and psychosocial fatigue perception, QoL, and fatigue severity (P=0.001). However, its effect was not significant for cognitive fatigue perception (P>0.05). General linear models show that the percentages of variation, as explained by the aquatic exercises, were highest in the QoL and the physical and psychosocial fatigue perceptions. CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise can improve the QoL and decrease fatigue severity and fatigue perception, specifically in the physical and psychosocial domain for MS patients. However, it was not effective in improving cognitive fatigue perception.",

"Title": "Effects of a Short Physical Exercise Intervention on Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to investigate if a short-term endurance or combined endurance/resistance exercise program was sufficient to improve aerobic capacity and maximum force in adult patients (18-65 years) with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: All patients performed a three-month exercise program consisting of two training sessions per week, lasting 40 min each, with moderate intensity. All patients had a maximum value of 6 (low to moderate disability) on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). One group (combined workout group (CWG); 15 females, 4 males) completed a combined endurance/resistance workout (20 min on a bicycle ergometer, followed by 20 min of resistance training), while the other group (endurance workout group (EWG); 13 females, 5 males) completed a 40 min endurance training program. Aerobic capacity was assessed as peak oxygen uptake, ventilatory anaerobic threshold, and workload expressed as Watts. Maximum force of knee and shoulder extensors and flexors was measured using isokinetic testing. Quality of life was assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire, and fatigue was measured using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. RESULTS: Both training groups increased in aerobic capacity and maximum force. EWG, as well as CWG, showed improvement in several subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire and decrease of their fatigue. CONCLUSION: A short exercise intervention increased both aerobic capacity and maximum force independent of whether endurance or combined endurance/resistance workouts were performed.",

"Title": "Pilot randomized trial of progressive resistance exercise augmented by neuromuscular electrical stimulation for people with multiple sclerosis who use walking aids",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a home progressive resistance training (PRT) program augmented by neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). DESIGN: Randomized controlled pilot trial. SETTING: Participant homes. PARTICIPANTS: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) (N=37) who use a walking aid. INTERVENTIONS: A 12-week home PRT program or the same program augmented by NMES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Strength using hand-held dynamometry; repeated sit to stand test; Berg Balance Scale; timed Up & Go test; 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale; Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2; and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The NMES group also completed a device usability questionnaire. RESULTS: Only change in MFIS score was significantly greater in the NMES group than the PRT group (P=.012). The NMES group improved significantly in quadriceps endurance (median of change, 8.5; P=.043), balance (median of change, 3.5; P=.001), physical impact of MS (median of change, -8.3; P=.001), and impact of fatigue (median of change, -17; P=.001). Participants rated the device as highly usable. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a home PRT program with NMES is feasible, and the neuromuscular electrical stimulation device is usable by this population. Only reduction in impact of fatigue was greater in the NMES than the PRT group. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2015 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

"Title": "Effects of vestibular rehabilitation on multiple sclerosis-related fatigue and upright postural control: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue and impaired upright postural control (balance) are the 2 most common findings in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), with treatment approaches varying greatly in effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of implementing a vestibular rehabilitation program for the purpose of decreasing fatigue and improving balance in patients with MS. DESIGN: The study was a 14-week, single-blinded, stratified blocked randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Measurements were conducted in an outpatient clinical setting, and interventions were performed in a human performance laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight patients with MS were randomly assigned to an experimental group, an exercise control group, or a wait-listed control group. INTERVENTION: The experimental group underwent vestibular rehabilitation, the exercise control group underwent bicycle endurance and stretching exercises, and the wait-listed control group received usual medical care. MEASUREMENTS: Primary measures were a measure of fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), a measure of balance (posturography), and a measure of walking (Six-Minute Walk Test). Secondary measures were a measure of disability due to dizziness or disequilibrium (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) and a measure of depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II). RESULTS: Following intervention, the experimental group had greater improvements in fatigue, balance, and disability due to dizziness or disequilibrium compared with the exercise control group and the wait-listed control group. These results changed minimally at the 4-week follow-up. Limitations The study was limited by the small sample size. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms associated with the changes in the outcome measures due to the vestibular rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: A 6-week vestibular rehabilitation program demonstrated both statistically significant and clinically relevant change in fatigue, impaired balance, and disability due to dizziness or disequilibrium in patients with MS.",

"Abstract": "Background and aims: The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of mat Pilates and reformer Pilates on balance, strength, mobility, fatigue and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Study planned randomized, controlled, singleblind. Patients (EDSS=4) are divided into 3 groups; Mat Pilates (n=12), Reformer Pilates (n=13) and control group (n=13). Patients were evaluated with Berg Balance Scale, static balance tests, Timed Up and Go test, Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQOL-54). Additionally extremities muscle strength and core endurance-power were evaluated. Results: As a result of mat Pilates and reformer Pilates applications, in both groups balance, mobility, upper lower extremity muscle strength, Ã¢â‚¬Å“coreÃ¢â‚¬Â of stability and quality of life was increased (p<0.05), fatigue was observed as reduced (p<0.05). There was no difference in the control group (except for physical and psychosocial dimensions of FIS and physical dimensions of MSQOL-54) (p>0.05). When the amount of change was compared in two Pilates groups, in the development of left hip flexion, right hip extension, right shoulder flexion and right elbow flexion muscle strength was higher in the Reformer Pilates group (p<0.05) in the other parameters was observed that the gain was similar (p>0.05). Conclusion: In light of these results mat Pilates or reformer Pilates in patients with MS seems to be effective in improving balance, strength, mobility, fatigue and quality of life, and there is no significant difference between the two methods.",

"Title": "Effectiveness of rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis relapse on fatigue, self-efficacy and physical activity",
"Abstract": "Relapse of disease is one of the most prominent characteristics of multiple sclerosis. Effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes on fatigue, self-efficacy (SE) and physical activity (PA) has not been investigated so far in context of relapse. The aim of our study was to examine if rehabilitation programme in addition to high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) during relapse of disease can influence fatigue, SE and PA more than corticosteroid therapy alone. Patients were randomized in control group receiving only HDMP and experimental group which was in addition included in rehabilitation programme. Outcome measures used were Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Multiple Sclerosis Self- Efficacy scale (MSSES), Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), completed on baseline, 1 and 3Ã‚Â months later. There was no significant change in FSS in both time points, despite different trend seen between groups. The mean MSSES for function and control improved significantly in treatment group after 1Ã‚Â month (807.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 96.8, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005; 665.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 145.1, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05) and 3Ã‚Â months (820Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 83.5, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004; 720.0Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 198.2, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.016.) compared to baseline values. The mean GLTEQ score was significantly higher in the treatment group compared to the control at both follow-up time points (45.7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 7.6, pÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.001; 34.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 22.4, pÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.01). Rehabilitation started along with corticosteroid treatment induced significant improvement in PA compared to HDMP therapy alone. It also influenced noticeable changes in self-efficacy, but effect on fatigue was insufficient.",

"Title": "Robot-assisted gait training in subjects affected by multiple sclerosis: Effects on locomotor function and motor unit firing",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Locomotor disability in persons with Multiple Sclerosis can be considered as an emergent characteristic deriving from several mechanisms of functional impairments, including coordination of posture and gait [1]. It has been previously reported that multiple sclerosis impairs neuromuscular recruitment as a result of the demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that affects upper motor neurons. This central impairment has been shown to decrease maximal voluntary motor unit firing rates which results in reduced force production. Gait training with orthosis Lokomat may offer advantages beyond over-ground training, in terms of patient safety, reduced fear of falling, more steps practiced, and repeatability of a consistent gait pattern [2]. It seems important to study muscle force and the firing rate of motor units to fully understand the etiology of muscle weakness in multiple sclerosis subjects and the effects of specific rehabilitative training programs [3]. Methods: We studied 40 MS patients (mean age 53Ã‚Â±10 years) with no relapse during the last six months and moderate to severe gait impairments defined as Expanded Disability Status Scale (score: 6-7). Subjects have been randomized to Robot Assisted Gait Training (RAGT) or Conventional Therapy (CT). The RAGT group received 12 training sessions with gait orthosis Lokomat over 6 weeks. The control group received 12 sessions of conventional therapy. Primary outcomes measure were the six-minute walking test (6MWT), the Berg Balance Test (BBT), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and the 10 min walking test (10mWT). Secondary outcomes were self-reported questionnaire on fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), quality of life Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Moreover the subjects performed two functional exercise: the first is the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of knee extensor muscles; the second consists of an isometric contraction of the knee extensors, maintaining a force level of 20%, 50%, or 75% of MVC. Motor unit firing rate analysis has been performed through the analysis of surface EMG signals during the contraction. We analysed the power spectrum in the frequency domain and the root mean-square of the EMG signal. Results: The clinical data were analysed with Wilcoxon test. After 3 and 6 weeks, the RAGT group improved walking endurance (6 MWT) and balance (Berg Scale) (p < 0.05); also gait speed increased without any statistically significant differences. Each patients of RAGT and CT group improved the Quality of life (SF-36) at the end of the training program and three months later (p < 0.05). The balance improved statistically significant in the RAGT group compared with CT group after 3 weeks and at the end of the therapy (p < 0.05). After the treatment, patients were able to deliver an isometric force of the knee extensor greater than the baseline but no statistically significant. EMG signal analysis showed no significant changes. Discussion: Robot assisted-gait training is effective on gait speed, endurance and balance. Conventional and robotic training improve quality of life and this effect is long-lasting. As we did not observed any significant difference of the delivered force neither of the EMG parameters after the treatment, the functional improvement seems not due to a modification in muscle output.",

"Title": "Evaluation of the effectiveness of home based or hospital based calisthenic exercises in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of calisthenic exercises on balance, walking speed, fatigue, quality of life, and psychological status in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed with MS were randomized into two exercise groups (group 1 = hospital-based, group 2 = home-based). Outcome measures including the MS International Quality of Life Scale, 10-meter walking test, Berg Balance Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Inventory were assessed at the baseline and at 12-weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-six participants completed the exercise programme (hospital based = 16, home based = 20). The mean age was 32.83 +/- 3.64 years. The mean duration of disease was 6.97 +/- 3.15 years. Hospital-based and home-based exercise groups had significant improvements in the balance, 10-meter walking test, anxiety, and the quality of life after the 12-week exercise programme. There was a significant improvement in the hospital-based patients in terms of the depression scores. No significant improvement was observed in terms of fatigue in any of the groups. When both groups were compared, the improvement in the balance and depression scores of the hospital-based patients was significantly higher than the home-based patients. CONCLUSIONS: Calisthenic exercises can be easily performed both at home and in hospital setting. In patients with MS, calisthenic exercises performed at home or at the hospital may improve the balance, quality of life, and the functional and psychological status, while no significant effect has been observed on fatigue.",

"Title": "Cycling progressive resistance training for people with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled study",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of cycling progressive resistance training combined with balance exercises on walking speed, balance, fatigue, fear of falling, depression, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 45 patients were randomized into two exercise training (n = 30) groups and one control (n = 15) group. The patients in training group 1 (n = 15) underwent progressive resistance training on a bicycle ergometer and balance exercise, whereas group 2 (n = 15) patients received a home-based lower-limb strengthening and balance exercise. Outcome measures, including the duration of exercise, tolerated maximum workload, timed up and go test, Dynamic Gait Index, functional reach, Falls Efficacy scale, 10-m walk test, Fatigue Severity Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Short Form 36 scores, were assessed initially and at 8 wks. RESULTS: After dropouts, the whole study group consisted of 20 women and 13 men (mean age, 37.9 +/- 10.43 yrs). In training group 1, duration of exercise, tolerated maximum workload, timed up and go test, Dynamic Gait Index, functional reach, falls efficacy scale, 10-m walk test, Fatigue Severity scale, and Beck Depression Inventory scores, and in group 2, the mean duration of exercise, tolerated maximum workload, and Falls Efficacy scale scores were significantly improved after the training program (P < 0.05). There were no significant improvements in any of the outcome measurements in the control group (P > 0.05). In between-group comparisons, improvements in outcome measures of group 1 patients were significantly higher than those in other groups, except for 10-m walking test. Group 1 patients showed statistically significant improvement in physical functioning and role-physical functioning scales of the Short Form 36 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), and group 2 patients showed statistically significant improvement in only physical functioning scale of Short Form 36 (P < 0.05) after 8 wks. CONCLUSIONS: Specific exercise programs, including cycling progressive resistance training, may improve balance, fatigue, and depression and reduce fear of falling in patients with multiple sclerosis without worsening multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms.",

"Title": "Effect of aerobic interval training on serum IL-10, TNFa, and adipokines levels in women with multiple sclerosis: possible relations with fatigue and quality of life",
"Abstract": "Purpose: Multiple sclerosis is associated with immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation; however, possible relations between immunologic and metabolic factors and some psychological indexes such as fatigue and quality of life, especially in relation to exercise training, have not yet been investigated. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of aerobic interval training on interleukin-10/tumor necrosis factor ratio and adipokine (leptin and adiponectin) concentrations in women with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, the relationship between these factors with fatigue and quality of life were assessed. Methods: Forty women with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale =3) were randomized into either a non-exercising control or training group. The training group performed 8-weeks of upper and lower limb aerobic interval training. Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factora, interleukin-10, leptin, and adiponectin were measured before and after the 8-week intervention. Moreover, antropometric measures and measures for fatigue and quality of life were determined at the onset of and after exercise training. Results: The results revealed that leptin and tumor necrosis factora levels significantly decreased subsequent to the aerobic interval training. Although blood adiponectin levels considerably increased in the training group, interleukin-10 and interleukin-10/tumor necrosis factora ratio underwent no substantial change after the exercise training. In addition, the aerobic interval training was associated with improvement in fatigue, quality of life, and maximal oxygen consumption. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that aerobic interval training can be an effective strategy for managing the immune system at least by its significant impact on inflammatory cytokines and adipokines levels in women with multiple sclerosis. Additionally, this positive impact improved fatigue and adipose tissue indicators.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of a Pilates exercise programme on walking and balance in people with multiple sclerosis and compare this exercise approach to conventional physical therapy sessions. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. SUBJECTS: Forty-five people with multiple sclerosis, 29 females, mean age (SD) was 43.2 (11.6) years; mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (S.D) was 4.3 (1.3). INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 12 weekly training sessions of either Pilates ( n=22) or standardized physical therapy ( n=23) in an outpatient basis. MAIN MEASURES: Spatio-temporal parameters of walking and posturography parameters during static stance. Functional tests included the Time Up and Go Test, 2 and 6-minute walk test, Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance Scale and the Four Square Step Test. In addition, the following self-report forms included the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. RESULTS: At the termination, both groups had significantly increased their walking speed ( P=0.021) and mean step length ( P=0.023). According to the 2-minute and 6-minute walking tests, both groups at the end of the intervention program had increased their walking speed. Mean (SD) increase in the Pilates and physical therapy groups were 39.1 (78.3) and 25.3 (67.2) meters, respectively. There was no effect of group X time in all instrumented and clinical balance and gait measures. CONCLUSIONS: Pilates is a possible treatment option for people with multiple sclerosis in order to improve their walking and balance capabilities. However, this approach does not have any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy.",

"Title": "Effects of exercise on fitness and cognition in progressive MS: a randomized, controlled pilot trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise may have beneficial effects on both well-being and walking ability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise is shown to be neuroprotective in rodents and may also enhance cognitive function in humans. It may, therefore, be particularly useful for MS patients with pronounced neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of standardized exercise as a therapeutic intervention for progressive MS, in a randomized-controlled pilot trial. METHODS: Patients with progressive MS and moderate disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 4-6) were randomized to one of three exercise interventions (arm ergometry, rowing, bicycle ergometry) for 8-10 weeks or a waitlist control group. We analyzed the drop-out rate as a measure of feasibility. The primary endpoint of the study was aerobic fitness. Secondary endpoints were walking ability, cognitive function as measured by a neuropsychological test battery, depression and fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients completed the trial (10.6% drop-out rate). Significant improvements were seen in aerobic fitness. In addition, exercise improved walking ability, depressive symptoms, fatigue and several domains of cognitive function. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that aerobic training is feasible and could be beneficial for patients with progressive MS. Larger exercise studies are needed to confirm the effect on cognition.

"Title": "Effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on chronic fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several rehabilitation programmes aim at reducing the impact of fatigue in MS patients. Acute and chronic fatigue should require different management. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of individually tailored, multidisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation (MDR) on chronic fatigue. METHODS: Forty-eight ambulatory MS patients with chronic fatigue were randomized to MDR or to MS-nurse consultation. Fatigue was assessed by the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS-20R). Secondary outcomes included the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Functional Independence Measure, Disability and Impact Profile (DIP), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and the Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA). RESULTS: The primary outcome measure CIS-20R overall score showed no significant differences between groups at 12 weeks (P?=?0.39) and 24 weeks follow-up (P?=?0.14), nor for subscales (t?=?12 and t?=?24, 0.19=P=0.88). No significant within-group effects were found for both groups with respect to the primary (0.57=p=0.97) and secondary (0.11=p=0.92) outcome measures from baseline to 12 or 24 weeks. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was not more effective in terms of reducing self-reported fatigue in MS patients compared to MS-nurse consultation. Our results suggest that chronic fatigue in patients with MS may be highly invariant over time, irrespective of interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: controlled-trials.com ISRCTN05017507.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was to investigate the comparative effects of massage therapy and exercise therapy on patients with multiple sclerosis. The secondary aim was to investigate whether combination of both massage and exercise has an additive effect. DESIGN: Randomized controlled pilot trial with repeated measurements and blinded assessments. SETTING: Local Multiple Sclerosis Society. SUBJECTS: A total of 48 patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned to four equal subgroups labelled as massage therapy, exercise therapy, combined massage-exercise therapy and control group. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment group received 15 sessions of supervised intervention for five weeks. The massage therapy group received a standard Swedish massage. The exercise therapy group was given a combined set of strength, stretch, endurance and balance exercises. Patients in the massage-exercise therapy received a combined set of massage and exercise treatments. Patients in the control group were asked to continue their standard medical care. MAIN MEASURES: Pain, fatigue, spasticity, balance, gait and quality of life were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: Massage therapy resulted in significantly larger improvement in pain reduction (mean change 2.75 points, P = 0.001), dynamic balance (mean change, 3.69 seconds, P = 0.009) and walking speed (mean change, 7.84 seconds, P = 0.007) than exercise therapy. Patients involved in the combined massage-exercise therapy showed significantly larger improvement in pain reduction than those in the exercise therapy (mean change, 1.67 points, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Massage therapy could be more effective than exercise therapy. Moreover, the combination of massage and exercise therapy may be a little more effective than exercise therapy alone.",

"Title": "Specific exercise training in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Neurological symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) have a high impact of daily living, fatigue, motor weakness, spasticity, poor balance, heat sensitivity and mental depression. Although exercise training is an important therapeutic strategy to minimize the loss of functional capacity, it remains under-utilized as an intervention strategy in the MS population. The effect of specific exercise therapy programs on the management of balance and walking disorders in patients with MS have not been fully explained yet. Reproducible measurement systems are especially required to show their efficacy. Objective: To test the hypothesis that specific exercise training can improve coordination, equilibration and gait impairment, secondarily muscle strength, spasticity and the functional capacity in patients with MS. Methods: A randomized placebo controlled observational multicenter pilot trial with a 12-week study period was performed. Subjects: 49 patients with MS and an EDSS from 0-6.5 were randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Intervention: Group 1 (n=24) received twelve weeks of gymnastic training using different bodyweight exercises. Group 2 (n=25) were taken as control group without any additional physical activity. Main Measures: To measure equilibration, coordination and gait impairment, and level of spasticity, patients were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post treatment with a neurological examination, maximum muscle strength, Modified Ashworth Scale and visual analogue scale. Results: At the baseline we found 83 % of the participants with muscle strength differences with more than 10% in side comparison of leg, arm and core muscles. After 12 weeks intervention 18% of the muscle strength side differences could be reduced. The standardised specific exercise training improved significantly muscle strength. The quality of life and fatigue showed amelioration. Conclusions: Specific exercise training once a week is an important and easily performed tool to improve focal neurological deficits, especially motor weakness, spasticity and gait impairment in patients with MS. Additionally the quality of life is increased and fatigue ameliorated.",

"Title": "Does robot-assisted gait training improve ambulation in highly disabled multiple sclerosis people? A pilot randomized control trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Robotic training is commonly used to assist walking training in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) with non-conclusive results. Objective: To compare the effect of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) with that of conventional walking training (CWT) on gait competencies, global ability, fatigue and spasticity in a group of severely affected patients with MS. Methods: A pilot, single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 43 severe (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6-7.5) and non-autonomous ambulant in-patients with MS. Experimental group performed 12 sessions of RAGT, whereas control group performed the same amount of CWT. Primary outcome measures were gait ability assessed by 2 minutes walking test and Functional Ambulatory Category; secondary outcomes were global ability (modified Barthel Index), global mobility (Rivermead Mobility Index), severity of disease (EDSS) and subjectively perceived fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale). Results: The number of subjects who achieved a clinical significant improvement was significantly higher in RAGT than in CWT (p < 0.05 for both primary outcome measures). RAGT also led to an improvement in all the other clinical parameters (global ability: p < 0.001, global mobility: p < 0.001, EDSS: p = 0.014 and fatigue: p = 0.001). Conclusions: RAGT improved the walking competencies in non-autonomous ambulant patients with MS, with benefits in terms of perceived fatigue.",

"Title": "Positive impact of regular circuit training on muscle strength, stability, depression and fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients",
"Abstract": "Background: A positive effect of aerobic or resistance training has been described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, only a few papers were dedicated to the use of circuit training in patients with MS. Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the response of MS patients with mild to moderate disability to the circuit training with aerobic activities and the response to the circuit training with aerobic plus resistance exercises. Methods: Fifty MS patients participated in aerobic plus resistance circuit training (AER) or in resistance circuit training (RES), both with frequency of two times a week for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the training programme. Physical assessment includes: muscle strength of lower limbs - knee flexors and extensors measured with a dynamometer, balance assessment with balance master (sensory organization test; SOT), walking tests - timed 25 foot walk test, 4 minute walk test, timed up and go test. Psychological assessment includes: modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), Beck depression inventory (BDI), the short form 36 health survey (SF36). Results: MS patients were randomly allocated to the exercise groups (24 had aerobic resistance circuit training and 26 had resistance circuit training). There were seven men and 63 women, median age 43 years (range 23-68 years), median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.5 (range 1.5-6). Four patients did not complete the study (two from each group) for noncompliance or unrelated injuries. To investigate the relationship between AER and RES circuit training we have performed mixed models analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), EDSS and disease duration. We have shown a significant effect of both types of regular circuit training on the strength of knee flexors (P=0.013), strength of knee extensors (P=0.014), standing stability in SOT test (P=0), reduction of fatigue (P=0.052), reduction of depression (P=0.011). Conclusion: Both types of circuit training (AER and RES) on a regular basis had a significant effect on physical parameters (muscle strength of lower limbs and stability during stance) as well as on psychological parameters (fatigue perception and depression). Both types of circuit training activities were well tolerated by MS patients, regardless of age or disability level. There was no significant difference in outcomes of the two regimens.",

"Title": "Comparing individualized rehabilitation to a group wellness intervention for persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: Compare the efficacy of two interventions designed to promote health and physical activity (PA). DESIGN: This study was a randomized clinical trial using a time series design. Subjects were randomized into individualized physical rehabilitation (IPR) and group wellness intervention (GWI). Primary questionnaires were administered twice preintervention and twice postintervention. Physical fitness and PA frequency were assessed preintervention and postintervention. SETTING: Clinic based in a metropolitan area. SUBJECTS: Fifty volunteers with multiple sclerosis. INTERVENTIONS: IPR consisted of four physical therapy sessions plus three telephone calls. GWI consisted of seven educational sessions. MEASURES: Primary: SF-36 Health Survey, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Mental Health Inventory. Secondary: physical assessment, PA frequency. ANALYSIS: Stability of primary questionnaires between the two pretests was examined. Efficacy of interventions was evaluated by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and effect sizes. RESULTS: Primary measures were stable between pretests. MANOVA showed nonsignificant differences between interventions. Eight weeks postintervention, both groups had improved PA, fatigue, resting heart rate, and strength. Effect sizes suggested that IPR had a greater effect on preventing decline of physical health, whereas GWI had a greater effect on improving mental health. CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence indicated that health and PA improved in both groups. Effect sizes suggested that participants benefited more physically from IPR and more mentally from GWI. Future research should determine whether combining therapeutic exercise with group education improves both mental and physical health.",

"Title": "Impact of aerobic training on fitness and quality of life in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Fifty-four multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were randomly assigned to exercise (EX) or nonexercise (NEX) groups. Before and after 15 weeks of aerobic training, aspects of fitness including maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max), isometric strength, body composition, and blood lipids were measured. Daily activities, mood, fatigue, and disease status were measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and neurological examination. Training consisted of 3 x 40-minute sessions per week of combined arm and leg ergometry. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were unchanged, except for improved bowel and bladder function in the EX group. Compared with baseline, the EX group demonstrated significant increases in VO2max, upper and lower extremity strength, and significant decreases in skinfolds, triglyceride, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). For the EX group, POMS depression and anger scores were significantly reduced at weeks 5 and 10, and fatigue was reduced at week 10. The EX group improved significantly on all components of the physical dimension of the SIP and showed significant improvements for social interaction, emotional behavior, home management, total SIP score, and recreation and past times. No changes were observed for EX or NEX groups on the FSS. Exercise training resulted in improved fitness and had a positive impact on factors related to quality of life.",

"Title": "Exercising Impacts on Fatigue, Depression, and Paresthesia in Female Patients with Multiple Sclerosis",
"Abstract": "PURPOSE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease impacting both body and mind. Typically, patients with MS report fatigue, depression, and paresthesia. Standard treatment consists of immune modulatory medication, though there is growing evidence that exercising programs have a positive influence on fatigue and psychological symptoms such as depression. We tested the hypothesis that, in addition to the standard immune regulatory medication, either yoga or aquatic exercise can ameliorate both fatigue and depression, and we examined whether these interventions also influence paresthesia compared with a nonexercise control condition. METHODS: Fifty-four women with MS (mean age: M = 33.94 yr, SD = 6.92) were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: yoga, aquatic exercise, or nonexercise control. Their existing immune modulatory therapy remained unchanged. Participants completed questionnaires covering symptoms of fatigue, depression, and paresthesia, both at baseline and on completion of the study 8 wk later. RESULTS: Compared with the nonexercise control condition and over time, fatigue, depression, and paresthesia decreased significantly in the yoga and aquatic exercise groups. On study completion, the likelihood of reporting moderate to severe depression was 35-fold higher in the nonexercise control condition than in the intervention conditions (yoga and aquatic exercising values collapsed). CONCLUSION: The pattern of results suggests that for females with MS and treated with standard immune regulatory medication, exercise training programs such as yoga and aquatic exercising positively impact on core symptoms of MS, namely, fatigue, depression, and paresthesia. Exercise training programs should be considered in the future as possible complements to standard treatments.",

"Title": "The effects of robot-assisted gait training in progressive multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Gait and mobility impairments are common in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), leading to reduced quality of life (QoL). Objective: In this randomized controlled study, we tested the effects of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) and compared it to conventional physiotherapy, measuring walking ability, depression, fatigue, and QoL in patients with progressive MS and severe gait disability. Methods: Fifty-two participants (Expanded Disability Status Scale score 6-7) completed the study protocol. They received two sessions/week over 6 weeks of RAGT or conventional walking therapy. Outcome measures were Six-Minute Walk Test, Ten-Meter Walk Test, Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Short Form 36. They were performed pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 months. Results: Walking endurance (p < 0.01) and balance (p < 0.01) were improved among those in the RAGT group. Positive effects on depression in both treatment groups were highlighted. However, only among those in the RAGT group was perceived physical functioning QoL increased. No significant effects on fatigue were found. Conclusion: RAGT is a treatment option in progressive MS patients with severe gait impairments to induce short-lasting effects on mobility and QoL.",

"Title": "Effect of combination exercise therapy on walking distance, postural balance, fatigue and quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients: A clinical trial study",
"Abstract": "Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the nervous system which has numerous disabling effects on patients. Objectives: This study aimed at investigating the short- and long-term effects of a period of combination exercise therapy on walking distance, balance, fatigue and quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients referred to the physiotherapy clinic of Iran's Multiple Sclerosis Society in 2013. Patients and Methods: This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial on 59 patients divided into the intervention (n = 39) and control groups (n = 20). The intervention group received 10 weeks of combination therapy including aerobic, strengthening, balancing and stretching exercises. A week before, a week later and a year after the beginning of the exercises, both groups of patients received BBSS, six minute walking, Family Support Services (FSS), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and quality of life tests. The scores of two groups were then compared using statistical tests such as repeated measures ANOVA test. Results: The results indicated significant changes in the intervention group in comparison to the control group in the second phase of the study comparing to the first one for all tests except EDSS (Mean difference scores of EDSS: -0.13), P-value = 0.60; FSS: -6.9, P-value = 0.02, Mental Quality of Life (QOL): 16.36, P-value = 0.001; Physical QOL: 12.17, P-value = 0.001, six minute walking: 137.2, P-value < 0.0001; and Berg: 3.34, P-value < 0.0001. These changes were not significant in the second phase of the study comparing to the third one; however, they were again significant in the third phase comparing to the first phase of the study (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Exercise has significant effect on improving symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and cessation of exercise may cause recurrence of symptoms in the intervention group with a slope similar to that of the control group. Therefore, continuous rather than short period exercises have valuable symptomatic and supportive relief effects in patients. Ã‚Â© 2014, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.",

"Abstract": "The influences of exercise on cytokine response, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and fatigue are important aspects of MS rehabilitation. Physical exercises performed within these programs are often practiced in water, but the effects of immersion have not been investigated. To investigate the influences of short-term immune responses and cardiorespiratory fitness on HR-QoL and fatigue during 3 weeks endurance training conducted on a cycle-ergometer or an aquatic-bike. Randomized controlled clinical trial in 60 MS patients. HR-QoL, fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness, and short-term immune changes (serum concentrations in response to cardiopulmonary exercise test) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin-6, and the soluble receptor of IL-6 (sIL-6R) were determined at the beginning and end of 3 weeks of training intervention. Subjects performed daily 30 min training at 60 % of their VO2peak. SF-36 total (p = 0.031), physical (p = 0.004), and mental health (p = 0.057) scores show time effects within both groups. Between-group effects were shown for FSMC total (p = 0.040) and motor function score (p = 0.041). MFIS physical fatigue showed time effects (p = 0.008) for both groups. Linear regression models showed relationships between short-term immune responses and cardiorespiratory fitness with HR-QoL and fatigue after the intervention. This study indicates beneficial effects of endurance training independent of the training setting. Short-term immune adaptations and cardiorespiratory fitness have the potential to influence HR-QoL and fatigue in persons with MS. The specific immune responses of immersion to exercise need further clarification.",

"Title": "Randomized controlled trial of yoga and exercise in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of yoga and of aerobic exercise on cognitive function, fatigue, mood, and quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Subjects with clinically definite MS and Expanded Disability Status Score less than or equal to 6.0 were randomly assigned to one of three groups lasting 6 months: weekly Iyengar yoga class along with home practice, weekly exercise class using a stationary bicycle along with home exercise, or a waiting-list control group. Outcome assessments performed at baseline and at the end of the 6-month period included a battery of cognitive measures focused on attention, physiologic measures of alertness, Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), and Short Form (SF)-36 health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects were recruited and randomized. Twelve subjects did not finish the 6-month intervention. There were no adverse events related to the intervention. There were no effects from either of the active interventions on either of the primary outcome measures of attention or alertness. Both active interventions produced improvement in secondary measures of fatigue compared to the control group: Energy and Fatigue (Vitality) on the SF-36 and general fatigue on the MFI. There were no clear changes in mood related to yoga or exercise. CONCLUSION: Subjects with MS participating in either a 6-month yoga class or exercise class showed significant improvement in measures of fatigue compared to a waiting-list control group. There was no relative improvement of cognitive function in either of the intervention groups.",

"Abstract": "Introduction: Non-pharmacological rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an important topic. Only little is known about the effects of physical effects on fatigue. Objective: To explore the effects of progressive resistance training (PoRT) with weight machines versus core and stability training in groups (CoaST) using the body weight compared to a waiting group on motor and cognitive fatigue. Methods: A randomized multi-centre 3-arm interventional single blind study. SUBJECTS: 70 individuals with MS (mean age 46.3 years, mean EDSS 3.22). INTERVENTION: The three arms were PoRT, CoaST and waiting group without exercise training. Participants trained 60 minutes per week for an intervention period of 24 weeks. All assessments were held at baseline after 12 and 24 weeks. Mean Outcome Parameters: Neurological conditions were assessed by different questionnaires and tests: FSMC, BDI, SF-36, EDSS and MSFC. Results: At baseline participants of PoRT, CoaST and controlgroups suffer from a moderate fatigue with accentuation of severe motor fatigue and moderate cognitive fatigue. After 12 and 24 weeks of training patients of the CoaST group showed no significant changes of fatigue (mean 64). Patients of the PoRT group showed an amelioration (-5.79) after 24 weeks mainly due to a reduction from 29.45 to 25.53 of cognitive fatigue. The PoRT group showed the highest changes within the first 12 weeks of intervention. The control group showed no changes. Conclusions: Sixty minutes of PoRT showed a decrease of fatigue, particularly in cognitive fatigue. CoaST training showed no effects on fatigue. This indicates that individualized training on weight machines may be an efficient tool for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue. Further trials are required to investigate further training modalities for the therapy of fatigue especially cognitive fatigue and individual rehabilitation strategies.",

"Title": "Progressive resistance training did not improve walking but can improve muscle performance, quality of life and fatigue in adults with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few high-quality trials have examined the effects of progressive resistance training (PRT) on people with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of PRT for people with MS, focusing on improving the gait deficits common in this population. METHODS: Using a single blind randomized controlled trial, people with relapsing-remitting MS were randomly allocated to either a PRT program targeting the lower limb muscles twice a week for 10 weeks (n=36), or usual care plus an attention and social program conducted once a week for 10 weeks (n=35). Outcomes were recorded at baseline, week 10 and week 22. RESULTS: Participants attended 92% of training sessions, with no serious adverse events. At 10 weeks, no differences were detected in walking performance. However, compared with the comparison group PRT demonstrated increased leg press strength (16.8%, SD 4.5), increased reverse leg press strength (29.8%, SD 12.7), and increased muscle endurance of the reverse leg press (38.7%, SD 32.8). Improvements in favor of PRT were also found for physical fatigue (Mean difference -3.9 units, 95%CI -6.6 to -1.3), and the physical health domain of quality of life (Mean difference 1.5 units, 95%CI 0.1 to 2.9). At week 22 almost no between-group differences remained. CONCLUSION: PRT is a relatively safe intervention that can have short-term effects on reducing physical fatigue, increasing muscle endurance and can lead to small improvements in muscle strength and quality of life in people with relapsing-remitting MS. However, no improvements in walking performance were observed and benefits do not appear to persist if training is completely stopped.",

"Title": "Sensory integration balance training in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized, controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired sensory integration contributes to balance disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to compare the effects of sensory integration balance training against conventional rehabilitation on balance disorders, the level of balance confidence perceived, quality of life, fatigue, frequency of falls, and sensory integration processing on a large sample of patients with MS. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized, controlled trial involved 80 outpatients with MS (EDSS: 1.5-6.0) and subjective symptoms of balance disorders. The experimental group (n = 39) received specific training to improve central integration of afferent sensory inputs; the control group (n = 41) received conventional rehabilitation (15 treatment sessions of 50 minutes each). Before, after treatment, and at one month post-treatment, patients were evaluated by a blinded rater using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), number of falls and the Sensory Organization Balance Test (SOT). RESULTS: The experimental training program produced greater improvements than the control group training on the BBS (p < 0.001), the FSS (p < 0.002), number of falls (p = 0.002) and SOT (p < 0.05).

"Title": "Efficacy of a multi-faceted vestibular rehabilitation program: Balance and eye-movement exercises for persons with multiple sclerosis (BEEMS)",
"Abstract": "Research Objectives: To compare balance as a function of central sensory integration based on computerized dynamic posturography-sensory organization test (CDP-SOT) in persons with MS who performed a multi-faceted vestibular rehabilitation program (Balance and Eyemovement Exercises for Persons with MS; BEEMS) to those who did not receive BEEMS training, and compared CDP-SOT scores between BEEMS participants who had infratentrial (e.g., brainstem, cerebellum) lesion involvement to those who did not. Secondarily, the study investigated the efficacy of BEEMS to improve visual stability and symptomatic fatigue, dizziness, quality of life, and perceived cognitive deficits. Design: 2-arm, examiner-blinded, stratified (infratentorial involvement vs. no involvement) blocked randomized controlled trial. Setting: Academic Medical University Campus Research Laboratory. Participants: Candidate participants with MS aged 18 to 60 presenting with at least minimal impaired balance as a function of central sensory integration and symptomatic fatigue were eligible. Eighty-eight participants (44 with infratentorial lesion involvement) met eligibility criteria and were allocated to BEEMS or no treatment Control. Interventions: BEEMS consisting of standing and mobility-based balance and visual stability exercises: 1-hour supervised sessions 2x/wk for 6-wks, then 1x/wk for 8-weeks, for a total of 20 supervised sessions and daily home-based training. Main Outcome Measure(s): Balance as function of central sensory integration: CDP-SOT conditions 1-6 composite score, summated scores for conditions 1-2 and conditions 3-6. Symptomatic fatigue: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS); dizziness: Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI); quality of life: Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36 Mental and SF-36 Physical); self-reported cognitive status: Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ); gait speed: Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW); visual stability: Gaze Stabilization Test (GST) and Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT). Results: Compared to Control participants: after 6-weeks the BEEMS participants improved significantly in CDP-SOT composite scores (Least Squares Means Difference in Change; LSMDC = 5.2; p=0.003); summated scores of conditions 1-2 (LSMDC = 6.9; p=0.0003); and summated scores of conditions 3-6 (LSMDC = 21.6; p=0.006), and in MFIS total scores (LSMDC = 11.1; p<0.0001), DHI scores (LSMDC = 12.6; p<0.0001), in SF-36 Mental (LSMDC = 4.9; p=0.04) and SF-36 Physical (LSMDC = 3.5; p=0.006) scores, and in PDQ scores (LSMDC = 7.5; p=0.0005); and after 14-weeks the BEEMS participants improved significantly in CDP-SOT composite scores (LSMDC = 8.8; p<0.0001); summated scores of conditions 1-2 (LSMDC = 6.9; p=0.0006); and summated scores of conditions 3-6 (LSMDC = 38.9; p<0.0001), and in MFIS total scores (LSMDC = 12.0; p<0.0001), DHI scores (LSMDC = 14.1; p<0.0001), in SF-36 Physical (LSMDC = 3.3; p=0.02) scores, and in PDQ scores (LSMDC = 6.5; p=0.003). Changes in GST, DVAT, and T25FW scores were not significantly different between the groups at both time points. Changes in all outcomes were not significantly different between BEEMS participants with infratentorial lesion involvement compared to those without involvement. Conclusions: BEEMS significantly improves multiple important clinical outcomes. Results indicate that MS-related infratentorial lesion involvement does not affect the benefits of BEEMS supporting the generalizability of BEEMS for persons with MS who present with at least minimally impaired balance and symptomatic fatigue.",

"Title": "Does aerobic training alleviate fatigue and improve societal participation in patients with multiple sclerosis? The TREFAMS-A multicentre randomised trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Aerobic training may prove a viable treatment to alleviate the commonly reported fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, limited evidence is available for its effectiveness in fatigued patients with MS. Methods: Treating fatigue in multiple sclerosis - Aerobic training (TREFAMS-A) is a multicentre, observer-blinded, randomised controlled trial in 90 ambulant patients with MS suffering from severe fatigue. Patients were allocated 1:1 to 16 weeks individual, partly supervised, aerobic training or a control intervention consisting of three consultations with an MS-specialized nurse. Primary outcomes were perceived fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength [CIS] fatigue subscale) with, and societal participation (Impact on Participation and Autonomy [IPA] scale). An improvement of = 8 points on the CIS fatigue subscale was considered clinically relevant. Secondary outcomes included measures of physical fitness, and complementary fatigue measures. Assessments were performed at baseline, 8, 16, 26, and 52 weeks. Random coefficient analysis was used to assess the group-by-time interaction effects. This study is registered with Controlled-trials. com number ISRCTN69520623. Findings: Between 1 October 2011 and 1 October 2014, over 925 patients were approached, 207 patients with MS were assessed for eligibility, and 90 were included. The mean difference (MD) between-groups, post-intervention on the CIS fatigue subscale was 4.708 (Standard Error [SE] = 1.890; P = .014) in favour of aerobic training. This was preceded by a significant increase in peak power output following 8 weeks of training (MD = 11.701; SE = 5.868; P = .048). At 8 weeks, also a significant reduction on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale psychosocial subscale (MD = -0.771; SE = 0.325, P = .019) was shown. No significant effect was found on societal participation. Interpretation: Aerobic training in MS patients with severe fatigue does not lead to clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue and does not improve societal participation when compared to three consultations offered by an MS-specialized nurse.",

"Title": "Effects of aerobic and strength exercise on motor fatigue in men and women with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of aerobic and strength exercise on motor fatigue of knee flexor and extensor muscles in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: At Masku Neurological Rehabilitation Centre, Masku, and the Social Insurance Institution, Research Department, Turku, Finland. SUBJECTS: Ninety-five MS patients with mild to moderate disability were randomized into exercise group (n =47) and a control group (n =48). INTERVENTION: Participants in the exercise group attended in a supervised exercise period of three weeks, which was followed by a home exercise programme lasting for 23 weeks. Patients in the control group continued with their normal living. OUTCOME MEASURES: Motor fatigue of knee flexor and extensor muscles was measured during a static 30-s maximal sustained muscle contraction. The decline in force (Nm) during the 30 s was recorded, and a fatigue index (FI) was calculated. Subjective fatigue was measured by using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The Ambulatory Fatigue Index (AFI) was calculated on the basis of a 500-m walking test. Assessment took place at baseline, at the third week (not for the control group) and at the 26th week. All outcome variables were analysed, men and women together, and some interesting contrasts were analysed by gender. RESULTS: Associations were observed with changes in extension FI and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and mean extension torque (Nm), but not with changes in FI and aerobic or strength exercise activity, mean AFI, mean FSS or in mean knee flexion torque. AFI was decreased in all subject groups (p =0.007). Motor fatigue was reduced in knee flexion (p=0.0014) and extension (ns) among female but not in male exercisers after six months of exercise. The exercise activity of women was 25% higher than that of the men. CONCLUSIONS: Six months of exercise reduced motor fatigue in women, but not in men.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of group exercise training on balance, functional status, spasticity, fatigue and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: A randomized single-blind controlled study. SETTING: University hospital, outpatient physical therapy department. SUBJECTS: Ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. INTERVENTIONS: Exercise group completed a 12-week group exercise programme under the physical therapists' supervision. Control group was included in the waiting list. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were the Berg Balance Scale, 10-metre walk test, 10-steps climbing test and secondary outcome measures were the Modified Ashworth Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale and Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients completed the study. There were statistically significant improvements for all outcome measures in the group exercise group (n = 51) (p < 0.01). In the control group (n = 48), there were statistically significant negative change in the Berg Balance Scale and 10-metre walk test measures (p = 0.002, p = 0.001) and statistically significant increment only in the Fatigue Severity Scale score (p = 0.002). The Berg Balance Scale score was increased 4.33 in the exercise group, while a decreased of 2.33 in control group. The 10-metre walk test duration (second) was decreased 2.72 in exercise group, while increased 1.44 in control group. In comparing inter-groups changes, both primary and secondary outcome mesures showed significant improvements in favour of the exercise group after the training (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that supervised group exercise training is effective in improving balance, functional status, spasticity, fatigue and quality of life in moderately affected people with multiple sclerosis, with no worsening of their clinical status.",

"Title": "The impact of outpatient rehabilitation on quality of life in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "It is well accepted that rehabilitative treatment can be effective in reducing disability and optimizing quality of life (QoL) of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitative treatment on QoL in patients suffering from MS. We selected 111 patients from a sample of 407 patients who had consecutively entered the MS Center of Catania (which is located in southern Italy) in 1998. Fifty-eight were randomly assigned to the study treatment and 53 to a waiting list (control treatment). Kurtzke's EDSS and quality of Life (QoL)were the primary endpoints. QoL was measured with the generic multi-item SF-36 scales. We also used: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for depression, the Tempelaar Social Experience Check-list (SET) for social activities and the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS). The study treatment group was treated for 6 consecutive weeks, 6 days a week with a comprehensive rehabilitative outpatient model. The control treatment group was in a waiting list and was trained to self-exercises at home. EDSS remained unchanged in both groups. All health related QoL domains significantly improved in the study treatment (p < 0.001 in physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, and social functioning; p < 0.05 in vitality, role emotional and mental health). FIS, SET and BDI also improved significantly after the rehabilitative treatment in the study group (p < 0.001). The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of a short comprehensive outpatient model of rehabilitative treatment in people with MS and in particular in their QoL.",

"Abstract": "Background: Motor imagery and rhythmic auditory stimulation are physiotherapy strategies for walking rehabilitation. Objectives: To investigate the effect of motor imagery combined with rhythmic cueing on walking, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Individuals with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 1.5-4.5 were randomised into one of three groups: 17 minutes of motor imagery, six times per week, for 4 weeks, with music (A) or metronome cues (B), both with verbal cueing, and (C) controls. Primary outcomes were walking speed (Timed 25-Foot Walk) and distance (6-Minute Walk Test). Secondary outcomes were walking perception (Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and QoL (Short Form-36 Health Survey, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, Euroquol-5D-3L Questionnaire). Results: Of the 112 participants randomised, 101 completed the study. Compared to controls, both interventions significantly improved walking speed, distance and perception. Significant improvements in cognitive but not psychosocial fatigue were seen in the intervention groups, and physical fatigue improved only in the music-based group. Both interventions improved QoL; however, music-cued motor imagery was superior at improving health-related QoL. Conclusion: Rhythmic-cued motor imagery improves walking, fatigue and QoL in people with MS, with music-cued motor imagery being more effective.",

"Title": "Pragmatic intervention for increasing self-directed exercise behaviour and improving important health outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis: A randomised controlled trial",
"Abstract": "Background: Exercise programmes that can demonstrate evidence of long-lasting clinical effectiveness are needed forpeople with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a practically implemented exercise programme onself-directed exercise behaviour and important health outcomes in PwMS to nine months of follow-up.Methods: We conducted a parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial: 120 PwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 1.0-6.5) randomised to a three-month exercise intervention plus usual care, or usual care only. Two supervised plus one homeexercisesession (weeks 1-6) were followed by one supervised and two home-exercise sessions (weeks 7-12). Cognitivebehaviouraltechniques promoted long-term exercise behaviour change. Outcomes were blindly assessed at baseline and atthree and nine months after randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour (Godin Leisure TimeExercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)). Secondary outcomes included fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Results: The intervention increased self-reported exercise (9.6 points; 95% CI: 2.0 to 17.3 points; p = 0.01) andimproved fatigue (p<0.0001) and many HRQoL domains (p=0.03) at three months. The improvements in emotionalwell-being (p = 0.01), social function (p = 0.004) and overall quality of life (p = 0.001) were sustained for nine months.Conclusion: This pragmatic approach to implementing exercise increases self-reported exercise behaviour, improvesfatigue and leads to a sustained enhancement of HRQoL domains in PwMS.

"Title": "An internet-based at home training protocol enhances muscle strength and lung function in multiple sclerosis patients (#133)",
"Abstract": "Objective: Numerous studies have shown beneficial effects of exercise in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS). As shown recently (Motl et al. 2010), using internet technology might treat and supervise pwMS more economically and more individually than conventional interventions, but systematic studies are lacking. Thus, we assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of an internet-based at home physical training protocol (e-Training) in pwMS (EDSS 0-4). Methods: In a randomized controlled trial (9/2009 - 9/2011), pwMS were allocated to either control group (CG; no treatment) or training group (TG). The TG received internet-based strength (2x/week) and endurance training (1x/week). Participants exercised at home and documented their training sessions via internet. Training protocols were supervised and adjusted by sports therapists. Assessments at baseline and after 3 months of training included: Isometric muscle strength (knee and trunk flexion/extension), aerobic capacity (VO(2)max), lung function (peak expiratory flow PEF), physical activity (Baecke Questionnaire), Quality of Life (HAQUAMS) and Fatigue (WEIMuS). Outcomes are analysed using MANOVA with the factors time (within-subjects) and group (between-subjects). Results: We included 126 pwMS at baseline (m: 32, f:94; EDSS: 2,76Ã‚Â±0,85; age: 40,8Ã‚Â±9,9), of which 107 completed the posttest (dropout 15,1%). Compared to the CG, the TG showed significant improvements in knee flexion (p=.007) and extension (p=.012), but not trunk flexion or extension. Peak expiratory flow increased significantly (p=.035), as well as the sport score of the Baecke Questionnaire (p=.003). There were no intervention effects for VO(2)peak, fatigue or quality of life. Conclusion: Large sample size and low dropout rate indicate good acceptance and feasibility of the internet intervention. The significant increase in leg strength was comparable in magnitude to supervised strength training (De Souza-Texeira, 2009). Effects were also significant concerning lung function and sports activity. The absence of effects on VO(2)max could be due to the low dose of just one session per week of endurance training. Above-average baseline values concerning both fatigue (considerably below fatigue threshold) and Quality of life could explain the absence of corresponding intervention effects. Effects of exercise on Quality of life was mostly shown in endurance training and group interventions (Motl 2008); both of which was not focus of our study.",

"Title": "Exercise in the community for people with minimal gait impairment due to MS: an assessor-blind randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), additional information on the effectiveness of combining aerobic and resistance training, and yoga is required. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effectiveness of community exercise interventions for people with MS having minimal gait impairment. METHODS: A multi-centred, block-randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71). The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) 29v2 physical component, measured before and after the 10-week intervention. Secondary outcomes were the MSIS 29v2 psychological component, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). RESULTS: The group x time interaction approached significance for the MSIS-29v2 physical component (f = 2.48, p = 0.061) and MFIS total (f = 2.50, p = 0.06), and it was significant for the MFIS physical subscale (f = 4.23, p = 0.006). All three exercise interventions led to a statistically significant improvement on the MSIS-29 psychological component and both the MFIS total and physical subscales, which were greater than the control (p < 0.05). Only the PT-led and FI-led interventions significantly improved the MSIS-29 physical and 6MWT to levels greater than the control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the positive effect of exercise on the physical impact of MS and fatigue. The group nature of the classes may have contributed to the positive effects seen on the psychological impact of MS.",

"Title": "Baseline affect predicts improved fatigue with telerehabilitation using remotely-supervised transcranial direct current stimulation (RS-tDCS) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS)",
"Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate whether tDCS improves fatigue in MS and the role of baseline affect in response, using a remotely-supervised telerehabilitation protocol. Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that alters cortical excitability through low amplitude currents. Previous work suggests tDCS as a method for symptomatic management in MS. However, these initial studies have been limited due to small sample sizes and few active treatment sessions. Design/Methods: Participants completed ten 20 minute sessions of tDCS (1.5 mA, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left anodal) paired with cognitive training. Sessions were completed from home using our RS-tDCS protocol. All participants completed baseline and follow-up mood and fatigue self-report measures including the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Baseline positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) were z-transformed and averaged into a representative affect score. Results: Participants (n=25) aged 30 to 69 years with a range of impairment (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 1.0 to 8.0) and all subtypes were enrolled. RS-tDCS treatment led to clear improvements in both dimensions of affect (PA, Cohen's d = 0.32 and NA, d = -0.66) and fatigue (MFIS, d = -0.59). Participants' baseline affect score correlated with change in NA (r = 0.61, p < 0.01) and MFIS (r = 0.39, p = 0.06). Among participants who had a baseline affect z-score less than 0 (n=17) indicating affect disturbance, there was a greater magnitude of improvement and significant change from baseline (PA, d = 0.57, p=0.02; NA d = -1.07, p < 0.001; and MFIS d = -0.84, p<0.01). Conclusions: Telerehabilitation using RS-tDCS improves mood and fatigue in MS patients treated at home, with greater effects found in those with baseline features of mood or anxiety.",

Methods: We used the Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale; the five-point scale for muscle strength; Timed 25 foot walk test; Beck's Depression Inventory; Bladder and Bowel Control Scales from the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory and fatigue Severity Scale. The patients were evaluated on the first and on the last day of treatment. For statistical comparison of the results before and after treatment we used Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Results: All the studied symptoms, excluding fatigue, were significantly improved. 24 patients performed the Timed 25 Foot Walk Test and 16 (67%) had clinically significant improvement. None of the patients had any serious adverse events. Conclusion: Repetitive TMS is beneficial in the management of motor, affective, bladder and bowel symptoms in patients with MS. The procedure has excellent safety profile.",

"Abstract": "Mental fatigue and cognitive dysfunction are common symptoms at all stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), ones for which there are currently no effective treatments. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive intervention in which a weak electrical current applied through the scalp may modulate the activity in the underlying cerebral tissue. In this sham-controlled, single-blind crossover experiment, outpatients with secondary progressive MS received 2mA of anodal and sham tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 30 minutes, once a day for five consecutive days, while performing cognitive rehabilitative tasks. Primary outcome measures included the MACFIMS cognitive battery and Fatigue Severity Scale, which were completed at the beginning and end of each five-day study wave. Preliminary analyses revealed tDCS to be safe and well tolerated. There were relative reductions in fatigue and improvements on select measures of working memory, in response to anodal stimulation, whereas sham stimulation was associated with increased fatigue and modest working memory practice effects. There were no changes in depression. These preliminary findings suggest that tDCS may ameliorate fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in MS.",

"Title": "Probing the impact of prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Question: Fatigue frequently affects patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), has a profound negative impact on quality of life and is difficult to treat. Fatigue has been associated with functional and structural abnormalities of the frontal cortex. The aim of this study was to assess whether fatigue symptoms can be reduced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Methods: Excitability-enhancing tDCS (sham-controlled, double-blind) was applied for five consecutive days over the left prefrontal cortex of MS patients with fatigue. Symptoms were tracked for 1 month with known fatigue scales. Lesion load was calculated for each patient and correlated with fatigue levels and responsiveness to stimulation. Results: In the whole group analysis the scores of the fatigue scales were not altered by tDCS (Fig. 1). (Figure presented) However, in an exploratory analysis we found a correlation between response to the stimulation regarding subjectively perceived fatigue and lesion load: patients responding positively to anodal tDCS had higher lesion load in the left frontal cortex., compared to non-responding patients (Fig. 2). (Figure presented) Conclusion: We conclude that tDCS may be a tool for MS fatigue management in patient subgroups discernible by certain morphological alterations.",

"Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis-related fatigue is highly common and often refractory to medical therapy. Ten fatigued multiple sclerosis patients received two blocks of 5-day anodal bilateral primary somatosensory areas transcranial direct current stimulation in a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled, cross-over study. The real neuromodulation by a personalized electrode, shaped on the MR-derived primary somatosensory cortical strip, reduced fatigue in all patients, by 26 % in average (p = 0.002), which did not change after sham (p = 0.901). Anodal tDCS over bilateral somatosensory areas was able to relief fatigue in mildly disabled MS patients, when the fatigue-related symptoms severely hamper their quality of life. These small-scale study results support the concept that interventions modifying the sensorimotor network activity balances could be a suitable non-pharmacological treatment for multiple sclerosis fatigue.",

"Title": "Effects of left DLPFC versus right PPC tDCS on multiple sclerosis fatigue",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is a frequent and debilitating symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Its classical treatments are still faced with limited benefits and numerous side effects. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, on such a challenging symptom. Our secondary outcomes included the assessment of tDCS impact on mood and attentional performance. METHODS: Ten fatigued MS patients were enrolled in a double-blind, sham-controlled, and cross-over study. Each patient randomly received three anodal tDCS blocks: active stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), active stimulation over the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and sham stimulation over either cortical site. Both cortical targets are key components in the MS fatigue networks. The blocks consisted of five consecutive daily sessions and were held apart by a washout interval of three weeks. RESULTS: Only active left DLPFC stimulation significantly ameliorated fatigue. Mood improvement was exclusively obtained following active right PPC stimulation. Neither intervention had effects on attention. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the role of anodal tDCS over the left prefrontal in treating MS fatigue. The lack of tDCS effects on attention might be related to the heterogeneity of the studied cohort, the relatively small sample size, the protocol design and duration. Modifying these variables and coupling tDCS with neuroimaging might improve the clinical outcomes and enhance our understanding of the tDCS mechanism of actions.",

"Title": "Prefrontal tDCS decreases pain in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: In the last few years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as an appealing therapeutic option to improve brain functions. Promising data support the role of prefrontal tDCS in augmenting cognitive performance and ameliorating several neuropsychiatric symptoms, namely pain, fatigue, mood disturbances, and attentional impairment. Such symptoms are commonly encountered in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: The main objective of the current work was to evaluate the tDCS effects over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on pain in MS patients. Our secondary outcomes were to study its influence on attention, fatigue, and mood. Materials and Methods: Sixteen MS patients with chronic neuropathic pain were enrolled in a randomized, sham-controlled, and cross-over study. Patients randomly received two anodal tDCS blocks (active or sham), each consisting of three consecutive daily tDCS sessions, and held apart by 3 weeks. Evaluations took place before and after each block. To evaluate pain, we used the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Attention was assessed using neurophysiological parameters and the Attention Network Test (ANT). Changes in mood and fatigue were measured using various scales. Results: Compared to sham, active tDCS yielded significant analgesic effects according to VAS and BPI global scales. There were no effects of any block on mood, fatigue, or attention. Conclusion: Based on our results, anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC appears to act in a selective manner and would ameliorate specific symptoms, particularly neuropathic pain. Analgesia might have occurred through the modulation of the emotional pain network. Attention, mood, and fatigue were not improved in this work. This could be partly attributed to the short protocol duration, the small sample size, and the heterogeneity of our MS cohort. Future large-scale studies can benefit from comparing the tDCS effects over different cortical sites, changing the stimulation montage, prolonging the duration of protocol, and coupling tDCS with neuroimaging techniques for a better understanding of its possible mechanism of action.",

"Title": "Procedures and results using a remotely-supervised protocol for at-home access to tDCS in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Purpose: Research is needed to provide guidelines for safe and optimal clinical use of TES. With rapidly evolving technology, the possibility of home access can provide patient access by overcoming obstacles of time and travel. We have developed a remotely-supervised or RS-tDCS protocol to pair with telerehabilitation and for use in multiple sclerosis (MS) with potential application across other conditions. Methods: To develop the protocol, n=26 individuals with MS were trained in tDCS application, using a caregiver proxy for participants with higher levels of neurologicimpairment. Equipment was customized for use by those with limited manual dexterity and all procedures with streamlined for simplicity. After an initial baseline training session, nine additional sessions were administered remotely in real-time through videoconferencing. tDCS (1.5mAx 20 minutes)was paired with cognitive training. These participants were compared to a control group that completed cognitive training only using the same remotely-supervised procedures. Next, using the RS-tDCS protocol, n=20 individuals with MS were randomized to 20 sessions of active (2.0 mA) or sham tDCS. The primary outcomes included changes in mood, cognitive processing measures, and fatigue ratings. Results: A total of n=56 individuals with MS have self-administered tDCS using our RS-tDCS protocol for a total of over 650 sessions. Compliance has been higher than reported from studies requiring clinic visits with safety and tolerability at or better than reports. Initial benefit has been found for aspects of cognitive processing speed (complex attention, intra-individual variability in response time), mood, and fatigue. Discussion: Our RS-tDCS protocol is feasible for clinical study of benefits in MS and is can be adapted for use in individuals with awide range of neurologic disability. Initial efficacy has been observed in cognition, mood and fatigue.",

"Title": "Brain Plasticity Effects of Neuromodulation Against Multiple Sclerosis Fatigue",
"Abstract": "RATIONALE: We recently reported on the efficacy of a personalized transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatment in reducing multiple sclerosis (MS) fatigue. The result supports the notion that interventions targeted at modifying abnormal excitability within the sensorimotor network could represent valid non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed at assessing whether the mentioned intervention also induces changes in the excitability of sensorimotor cortical areas. METHOD: Two separate groups of fatigued MS patients were given a 5-day tDCS treatments targeting, respectively, the whole body somatosensory areas (S1wb) and the hand sensorimotor areas (SM1hand). The study had a double blind, sham-controlled, randomized, cross-over (Real vs. Sham) design. Before and after each treatment, we measured fatigue levels (by the modified fatigue impact scale, mFIS), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to median nerve stimulation. We took MEPs and SEPs as measures of the excitability of the primary motor area (M1) and the primary somatosensory area (S1), respectively. RESULTS: The Real S1wb treatment produced a 27% reduction of the mFIS baseline level, while the SM1hand treatment showed no difference between Real and Sham stimulations. M1 excitability increased on average 6% of the baseline in the S1wb group and 40% in the SM1hand group. Observed SEP changes were not significant and we found no association between M1 excitability changes and mFIS decrease. CONCLUSION: The tDCS treatment was more effective against MS fatigue when the electrode was focused on the bilateral whole body somatosensory area. Changes in S1 and M1 excitability did not correlate with symptoms amelioration. SIGNIFICANCE: The neuromodulation treatment that proved effective against MS fatigue induced only minor variations of the motor cortex excitability, not enough to explain the beneficial effects of the intervention.",

"Title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The debilitating fatigue that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly experience during day-to-day living activities responds poorly to current therapeutic options. Direct currents (DC) delivered through the scalp (transcranial DC stimulation or tDCS) at weak intensities induce changes in motor cortical excitability that persist for almost an hour after current offset and depend on current polarity. tDCS successfully modulates cortical excitability in various clinical disorders but no information is available for MS related fatigue. OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to assess fatigue symptom after five consecutive sessions of anodal tDCS applied over the motor cortex in patients with MS. METHODS: We enrolled 25 patients with MS all of whom experienced fatigue. We delivered anodal and sham tDCS in random order in two separate experimental sessions at least 1 month apart. The stimulating current was delivered for 15 minutes once a day for 5 consecutive days. In each session the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and the Back Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered before the treatment (baseline), immediately after treatment on day five (T1), one week (T2) and three weeks (T3) after the last tDCS session. RESULTS: All patients tolerated tDCS well without adverse events. The fatigue score significantly decreased after anodal tDCS in 65% of the patients (responders). After patients received tDCS for 5 days their FIS scores improved by about 30% and the tDCS-induced benefits persisted at T2 and T3. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that anodal tDCS applied over the motor cortex, could improve fatigue in most patients with MS.",

"Title": "Deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can improve depression and fatigue in multiple sclerosis: Results from a clinical phase 1/2a study",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue and depression are frequent symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting up to 90% at onset or during the course of the disease. The underlying pathobiology is poorly understood, and - as regards fatigue - evidence-based therapeutic strategies are limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown efficacy in the treatment of major depression. Recently developed TMS-coils, like the novel H-Coil, allow for stimulation of deeper brain regions, which are presumably involved in the complex pathophysiology of both fatigue and depression. Stimulation with the H-coil has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and efficacious in patients with major depression. Objective: To perform a randomized, sham-controlled phase I/IIa study to evaluate safety and efficacy of deep rTMS on fatigue and depression in patients with MS. This trial is registered as NCT01106365. Patients/Methods: 28 MS patients (42.9 Ã‚Â± 9.2 years) underwent 18 sessions of deep rTMS over a period of 6 weeks. Nine patients received true stimulation (18Hz, 120% resting motor threshold) of the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), 10 patients bilateral motor cortex (MC) stimulation (5Hz, 90% resting motor threshold) and 10 patients received sham stimulation over the left PFC. Fatigue was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Symptoms of depression were rated with the 18-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMDS) and the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: No significant changes in FSS and BDI were observed under sham- and true PFC stimulation conditions. In contrast, the MC group showed a non-significant trend of decrease in the FSS during the treatment period that reached significance in the follow up phase (-26,72% Ã‚Â± 16.3%, p=0.001). In addition, a significant decrease in BDI values could be observed under MC stimulation conditions as early as two weeks after first stimulation (-25.74%Ã‚Â±24.36%, p=0.013) reaching a maximum in the follow up phase (-39.23%Ã‚Â±21.57, p=0.001). Results of the other fatigueand depression rating scales were in line with FSS- and BDI results reported here. Conclusion: Our data suggest that deep rTMS of the motor cortex has the potential to ameliorate MS-related fatigue and depression that outlasts the time of stimulation.",

"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation primes the effects of exercise therapy in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Exercise therapy (ET) can be beneficial in disabled multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Intermittent transcranial magnetic theta burst stimulation (iTBS) induces long-term excitability changes of the cerebral cortex and may ameliorate spasticity in MS. We investigated whether the combination of iTBS and a program of ET can improve motor disability in MS patients. In a double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 30 participants were randomized to three different interventions: iTBS plus ET, sham stimulation plus ET, and iTBS alone. Before and after 2 weeks of treatment, measures of spasticity through the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and the 88 items Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Score questionnaire (MSSS-88), fatigue through the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), daily living activities (ADL) through the Barthel index and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through the 54 items Multiple Sclerosis Quality of life inventory (MSQoL-54) were collected. iTBS plus ET reduced MAS, MSSS-88, FSS scores, while in the Barthel index and MSQoL-54, physical composite scores were increased. iTBS alone caused a reduction of the MAS score, while none of the measured scales showed significant changes after sham iTBS plus ET. iTBS associated with ET is a promising tool for motor rehabilitation of MS patients.",

"Title": "Corticospinal reserve and disability predict efficacy of repetitive transcranial stimulation on walking abilities in people with progressive multiple sclerosis undergoing rehabilitation",
"Abstract": "Walking impairment has a strong impact on quality of life of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Excitatory Transcranial-Repetitive-Ma gnetic-Stimulation (rTMS) enhances corticospinal excitability and plasticity, potentially favouring the effects of neurorehabilitation. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of neurophysiological and clinical features on rTMS efficacy on walking in progressive MS patients undergoing neurorehabilitation. 42 progressive MS patients, randomized into real and sham-placebo rTMS, underwent 11 rTMS sessions during neurorehabilitation. Motor-threshold (RMT), duration of disease progression, walking speed (10mt-walking-test) and endurance (2 and 6 mwt) were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment, as well as Modified-Ashworth-Scale (MAS), pain and spasticity VAS, Fatigue-Severity-Scale, EDSS, MS-walking-scale-12, PASAT and nine-hole-peg-test. Real rTMS patients showed greater improvement both in 10mt (p = 0.007) and 6mwt (p = 0.04). Greater disability was associated with greater 6mwt improvement in all patients (p = 0.01) and in the real-rTMS subgroup (p = 0.04), not in sham. In real-rTMS group, RMT negatively correlated with 6mwt improvement (p = 0.003). The potential for improvement, greater in more disabled patients after rTMS, can be exploited using this treatment associated with neurorehabilitation. RMT, resulting from combination of corticospinal excitability and of corticomotor fibres available for conduction, could be considered a predictive marker of therapeutic response to rTMS neuromodulation.",

"Title": "Counteracting fatigue in multiple sclerosis with right parietal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients appears to correlate with vigilance decrement as reflected in an increase in reaction time (RT) and errors with prolonged time-on-task. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right parietal or frontal cortex counteracts fatigue-associated vigilance decrement and subjective fatigue. Methods: In study I, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) was delivered to the right parietal cortex or the right frontal cortex of 52 healthy participants during the first 20 min of a 40-min lasting visual vigilance task. Study II, also a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, investigated the effect of anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) over the right parietal cortex in 46 MS patients experiencing cognitive fatigue. tDCS was delivered for 20 min before patients performed a 20-min lasting visual vigilance task. Results: Study I showed that right parietal stimulation, but not right frontal stimulation, counteracts the increase in RT associated with vigilance decrement. Hence, only right parietal stimulation was applied to the MS patients in study II. Stimulation had a significant effect on vigilance decrement in mildly to moderately cognitively fatigued MS patients. Vigilance testing significantly increased the feeling of fatigue independent of stimulation. Conclusion: Anodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex can counteract the increase in RTs during vigilance performance, but not the increase in subjective fatigue. This finding is compatible with our model of fatigue in MS, suggesting a dissociation between the feeling and the behavioral characteristics of fatigue.",

"Title": "The impact of fampridine treatment on fatigue, quality of life and mood in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the principal cause of non-traumatic disability among young adults. Fampridine prolongs action potentials through the blockage of potassium channels, thus ameliorating neurotransmission in demyelinated axons and improving motor disability in patients with MS. Several post-marketing studies suggest fampridine might be beneficial in other domains. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of treatment with fampridine on life quality, fatigue and mood among MS patients. Methods: Prospective, post-marketing, single-center study, recruiting consecutive Portuguese patients eligible for treatment with fampridine, from November 2015 to March 2016. Evaluations were performed at baseline (D0) and after 14 days (D14) of treatment for gait velocity by Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), quality of life through Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), fatigue through Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Responders were defined as those having improved 20% or more in the T25FW at D14. Results: Twenty patients were included with different types of MS, 65% females, with a median age of 53 years old and a median Expanded Disability Status Scale of 6.0. Twelve patients (60%) were responder by D14 and in this group a significant improvement was observed comparing with D0 in FSS (median 39,0 vs 46,0; p=0,032) and FAMS (median 125 vs 115; p=0,012). In non-responders there was no significant improvement of FSS (median 37,5 vs 40,5; p=1,000) or FAMS (median 84,5 vs 82,5; p=0,932) after 14 days of therapy. Responders and non-responders did not present significant differences in mood score (HADS). Conclusions: Our results suggest a potential role of fampridine in improving not only walking speed but also other MS symptoms, namely life quality and fatigue, especially among timed walk responders. Further randomized, placebo-controlled studies will be needed to establish a definite role of fampridine in these domains.",

"Abstract": "Objective: Evaluate 1) the responsiveness of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) for multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue and 2) relationships between subjective fatigue assessment and measures of cognitive function. Background MS-related fatigue, including cognitive fatigue, is common. The MFIS is routinely used to measure MS-related fatigue but its responsiveness and ability to detect clinically important change after therapy is not known. Previous research found that cognitive performance and fatigue were not related. However, potentially more sensitive instruments such as the MFIS might detect an underlying relationship. Design/Methods: Ambulatory patients with MS-related fatigue persisting at least 6 weeks completed the MFIS, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), SF-36, and questionnaires. Cognitive performance measures included the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and others. All testing was administered on days 0, 7, and 21. Amantadine was initiated on day 7. Global assessment of change (GAC) comparing pre-to post-treatment status was rated as Ã¢â‚¬Å“poorÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“fairÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“goodÃ¢â‚¬Â, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“excellentÃ¢â‚¬Â. Paired t-tests and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate outcomes and correlations were calculated for mean change scores. Effect size and correlations between changes in MFIS, GAC, and PASAT were calculated. Results: 22 patients were enrolled. Improvement in post-treatment scores was detected for the MFIS (p=0.004) and the PASAT (p=0.02), among others. The MFIS effect size was moderate (0.61) but there was a weak association between MFIS change and GAC (r=0.26; NS). Changes in PASAT scores correlated with changes in the SF-36 physical subscale (r=0.42; p=0.05), MFIS-Cognitive subscale (r=0.39; p=0.07), and MFIS-Social subscale (r=0.37; p=0.09). Conclusions: Fatigue, as measured by the MFIS, may be associated with cognitive performance. However, despite moderate effect size, change in MFIS is not associated with qualitative self-assessment of therapeutic response. Further work is needed to find instruments that detect clinically important change in subjective fatigue and objective cognitive performance.",

"Title": "Dalfampridine effects on cognition, fatigue, and dexterity",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dalfampridine exerts beneficial effects on walking ability in a subgroup of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These patients are termed \"responders\". Here, we investigated whether the responder status with respect to mobility measures would determine whether dalfampridine treatment exerts a beneficial effect on other MS symptoms. We therefore assessed walking ability, upper limb function, cognition, fatigue, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), depression, and quality of life in patients before and after dalfampridine treatment. METHODS: Patients with MS and impaired mobility were recruited. Maximal walking distance, timed 25 Foot Walk, nine hole peg test, paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), fatigue severity scale (FSS), VEPs, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), EuroQol five dimensional questionnaire, and quality of life visual analogue scale were determined before and after 12-14 days of dalfampridine treatment. Repeated measures analysis of variance was applied to determine the effect of dalfampridine treatment. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients who completed the study, 22 patients were responders and 12 patients nonresponders, according to their performance in mobility measures. Treatment effects for the entire patient cohort were observed for PASAT (p = .029) and BDI (p = .032). Belonging to the responder cohort did not predict the response to treatment in these tests. For the FSS, response to dalfampridine treatment was dependent on the responder status (p = .001) while no effects in the total patient cohort were observed (p = .680). Other neurological functions remained unaltered. For VEP latencies, no significant improvements were detected. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed beneficial effects of dalfampridine on cognition, depression, and fatigue. These effects were not limited to patients who responded to dalfampridine with improved mobility measures. These findings underscore the need to assess the beneficial effects of dalfampridine on neurological deficits in MS patients in additional randomized clinical trials.",

"Title": "The impact of fampridine on fatigue, cognitive function, mood and quality of life",
"Abstract": "Objective: Fampridine is the only drug licensed to improve walking in all types of multiple sclerosis (MS) with a response rate of 30-74%. It acts as an inhibitor of potassium channels and restores nerve conduction. Previous studies have predominantly investigated the effect of fampridine on lower extremities motor functions while data on its impact on other symptoms of MS are scarce. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of fampridine on fatigue, cognitive function, mood and quality of life among responders. Methods: The final analysis of our prospective non-randomized study included 30 patients with different types of MS, aged 35-70, EDSS value 3.5-6.5. They were treated with 10 mg of fampridine twice daily. The examinations were performed before introducing the treatment, after 14 days of treatment, when responders were defined by T25FW, and after 28 days of treatment, when only the responders were examined. Standardized protocols and questionnaires were used to evaluate the impact of fampridine on walking speed (T25FW), fatigue (MFIS), cognitive function (PASAT), mood (BDI) and quality of life (EQ-5D index, EQ-VAS) in responders. Results: Responder rate was 56.7%. The average improvement of T25FW after 14 days of fampridine treatment among responders was 34.5 Ã‚Â± 8.2 %. This improvement persisted after 28 days of treatment as there was no statistical difference between the results of T25FW after 14 and 28 days in responders (p = 0.462). In nonresponders there was no significant improvement of T25FW after 14 days of therapy (p = 0.689). After 28 days of therapy significant improvement among responders occurred in BDI (p = 0.005), MFIS total score (p = 0.003), physical (p = 0.001), cognitive (p = 0.008) MFIS subscales, and EQ-5D index (p = 0.012). Statistically significant differences were not demonstrated in psychosocial MFIS subscale (p = 0.127), PASAT (p = 0.432) and EQ-VAS (p = 0.057). Conclusions: The results of our study highlight the potential of fampridine for improving not only walking speed but also physical and cognitive fatigue, mood and quality of life. There was no objective improvement of cognitive function. Further placebocontrolled studies will be needed for precise definition of fampridine's action beyond its impact on walking.",

"Title": "Effects of long-term treatment with prolonged-release fampridine on cognitive functioning in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Non-pharmacological interventions, such as ergotherapy, psychotherapy and cognitive rehabilitation may at least transiently improve cognition, but probably do not prevent the long-term decline of cognitive functions in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). In FAMPKIN, the original study of the EXTENSION described here, we found that treatment with prolonged-release fampridine (4-aminopyridine), a potassium-channel blocker, is associated with improvements in walking function, as well as fatigue. Despite increasing awareness of cognitive dysfunction in MS patients, past efforts to develop treatments for cognitive impairment in MS have largely been minimal or ineffective. Objectives: The aim of the present neuropsychological part of FAMPKIN EXTENSION is to study neuropsychological functions in patients with MS under fampridine therapy. Methods: 32 MS subjects of FAMPKIN EXTENSION were included and received continuous and unblinded treatment with fampridin PR (twice a day with 10mg) for 11.5 months. Cognitive functioning was assessed 2 times within one year using an established neuropsychological test battery as well as questionnaires to examine depression and fatigue. Tests were administered during continuous treatment with prolonged-release fampridine (V2), and within a 2 week treatment-free interval (V3). Changes between V2 and V3 were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signedrank test. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in testretest z scores for four of six target cognitive measures assessing attention (tonic alertness: V2: Mdn=264.50, V3: Mdn=271.50, z=-2.23, p< 0.05; selective attention, errors: V2: Mdn=1.00, V3: Mdn=0.00, z=-2.88, p< 0.01), psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol: V2: Mdn=43.00, V3: Mdn=49.50, z=-2.42, p< 0.05) and executive function (design fluency: V2: Mdn=18.50, V3: Mdn=13.00, z=-2.80, p< 0.05), always indicating better test performance under fampridine therapy. These cognitive effects were paralleled by patients' perception of reduced fatigue, evaluated with a standardized questionnaire (WEIMUS: motor fatigue, V2: Mdn=15.00, V3: Mdn=20.00, z=-2.57, p< 0.01; cognitive fatigue, V2: Mdn=10.50, V3: Mdn=14.00, z=-2.57, p< 0.05). Conclusions: Our data show that fampridine PR therapy positively impacts cognitive performance in MS patients by enhancing attention, psychomotor speed and executive function skills. These findings suggest that fampridine PR may reduce fatigue in this patient population.",

"Title": "Changes in Cognitive Processing Speed, Mood, and Fatigue in an Observational Study of Persons With Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Dalfampridine-ER",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative neurological condition that results in impairments in multiple domains including cognition, fatigue, and mood. Dalfampridine-extended release (D-ER) has been approved to improve walking in persons with MS. It is plausible that D-ER could improve cognition, fatigue, and mood through the same mechanisms. We aim to examine effects of D-ER on cognition, depression, mood, and fatigue and to describe how these associations differ among those with and without D-ER related improvements in walking speed. METHODS: Patients with MS at the Mandell Center who were newly prescribed D-ER as part of their standard MS care were invited to participate in this observational pre-post study. Thirty-nine participants with MS were observed for 14 weeks; 31 remained on D-ER for 14 weeks or longer. Of these, 28 were then subdivided based on walk responder status. Cognition was assessed using the SDMT; depression was measured with the CESD. Self-reported cognition, mood, and fatigue were also measured using subscales of the Performance Scales (PS). RESULTS: Among those on drug through 14 weeks, there was significant improvement in the SDMT (P < 0.001) and the PS Fatigue score (P = 0.04). Among those who discontinued drug before 14 weeks, PS Cognition and PS Mood scores significantly improved (P = 0.02). Timed walk responders had significant improvements in SDMT (P < 0.001) and PS Fatigue (P = 0.046) from baseline to week 14. Among timed walk nonresponders, none of the measures significantly changed. CONCLUSIONS: Dalfampridine-extended release may improve cognition and fatigue in persons with MS, especially among timed walk responders.",

"Title": "Modafinil for multiple sclerosis fatigue: does it work?",
"Abstract": "UNLABELLED: Modafinil is sometimes used in the clinical setting for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) fatigue, despite conflicting and disappointing results from clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: We audited the patient perceived effectiveness of modafinil when used in clinical practice in a carefully selected group of patients with typical MS fatigue. METHODS: All MS patients commenced on modafinil for fatigue in the Oxford MS clinic were identified retrospectively, and the patient perceived benefit, side effects and decision on continuation of therapy at 1 month was obtained from the medical notes. Additionally all patients were subsequently interviewed, up to 5 years after treatment initiation. RESULTS: Surprisingly, 69% patients with fatigue also suffered excessive daytime sleepiness, and this subgroup found modafinil more beneficial. There was a better response against excessive daytime sleepiness than fatigue. The benefit against fatigue or sleepiness was generally sustained (median 1 year). CONCLUSION: This suggests that modafinil may be useful, particularly when MS fatigue is associated with sleepiness. The relationship between fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness is poorly understood and needs to be better defined before appropriate measures of the most clinically relevant outcomes can be selected for clinical trials. Outcome measures used in previous clinical trials have not properly evaluated the effects of modafinil. Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

"Title": "Modafinil in treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis. Results of an open-label study",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modafinil is a unique wake-promoting agent that is chemically distinct from traditional stimulants. Results of a placebo-controlled study showed it to improve fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) at a dose of 200 mg daily, but not at a dose of 400 mg daily. OBJECTIVE: To establish the efficacy, safety and appropriate dose of modafinil in the treatment of fatigue and sleepiness in patients with multiple sclerosis. METHOD: A total of 50 patients diagnosed with MS (mean age 40.4 +/- 10.3 years, 30 females/20 males; MS type: 36 relapsing remitting, 1 primary progressive, 13 secondary progressive; mean disability level 3.8 +/- 1.5 on the Kurtzke EDSS) and complaining of chronic fatigue were enrolled in a prospective 3-month, two-center, open-label study. Efficacy was evaluated with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS, score range 0-42), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS, score range 0-24) and by subjective patient appraisal of change of fatigue, quality of life and overall satisfaction with treatment. Adverse effects (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. Treatment was started with a single daily dose of 100 mg in all patients. In non-responders the dose was increased by 100 mg increments up to a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. RESULTS: Three patients discontinued modafinil because of AEs (nervousness, dizziness). Two patients (4 %) were treated with 50 mg, 25 (50 %) with 100 mg, 21 (42 %) with 200 mg and 2 (4 %) with 300 mg daily. No patient required 400 mg daily. Mean FSS scores were 30.3 +/- 8.5 at baseline and 25.4 +/- 3.7 at 3 months (p < 0.0001). Mean ESS scores were 9.7 +/- 3.9 at baseline and 4.9 +/- 2.9 at 3 months (p < 0.0001). Self-appraisal of change of fatigue showed clear improvement in 41 patients (87.2 %), some improvement in 4 (8.5 %) and no change in 2 (4.3 %). Overall clinical condition was clearly improved in 43 patients (91.5 %), somewhat improved in 1 patient (2.1 %), and unchanged in 3 patients (6.4 %). No patient reported worsening of overall clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with modafinil significantly improves fatigue and sleepiness and is well tolerated by patients with MS. Unlike the higher dose regimen required in narcolepsy, a low-dose regimen of modafinil is effective in MS.",

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fampridine improves walking in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). However, little is known about its impact on the quality of life (QoL) of pwMS. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of fampridine on the QoL of pwMS and to determine if improvements in QoL are best associated with walk respondents. METHODS: Fifty pwMS were included in this study. The PERSEPP scale and the GaitRite system were used to evaluate QoL and gait respectively. QoL was evaluated 7Ã‚Â days before fampridine (Pre1), on the day the fampridine treatment was initiated (Pre2), and 14 and 21Ã‚Â days after fampridine (Post1 and Post2 respectively). Gait was assessed at Pre-1, Pre-2 and Post-1. RESULTS: For all patients, fampridine had significant effects (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05-10(-4), dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.25-0.45) on the Overall, Relationship difficulties, Fatigue, Time perspective and Symptoms QoL indices and for gait parameters (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05-10(-4), dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.17-0.38).

"Title": "Long-term course and clinical assessment parameters of patients with multiple sclerosis under dalfampridine",
"Abstract": "Background/Objective: Dalfampridine is the extended-release formulation of 4-aminopyridine and is approved for the symptomatic treatment of impaired mobility in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and an EDSS between 4 and 7. Previous studies have shown a significant improvement in the Timed 25 Foot-Walk (T25FW) in approximately one third of MS patients. However, studies evaluating the long-term therapeutic benefit of dalfampridine are still pending. Our aim was to examine the short- and long-term effects of dalfampridine treatment on motoric and cognitive assessment parameters of multiple sclerosis patients over 9-12 months.Design/Methods: 52 patients with MS with an EDSS between 4.0 and 7.0 and impaired mobility were evaluated for parameters of walking ability, MSFC, cognitive and motor fatigue and evoked potentials at treatment initiation with dalfampridine as well as 2 weeks and after 9-12 months later. The study included 34 female and 18 male patients with a mean EDSS of 5.3 +/- 0.02 and a mean age of 50 +/- 0.17.Results: 30 out of 52 patients (approx. 60%) were still on treatment after 9-12 months. Two weeks after treatment initiation, significant improvements were observed for T25FW, maximum walking distance as well as motoric and cognitive fatigue which still persisted after 9-12 months. In contrast significant effects for velocity were observed only after 2 weeks, for improvement in PASAT only after 9-12 months. A tendency for improvement of somatosensory evoked potentials was found in a subset of patients.Conclusions: Dalfampridine shows beneficial and clinically meaningful short- and long-term effects on motoric and cognitive assessment parameters in a significant proportion of patients with MS. Especially for the progressive forms of MS, where sufficient treatments are still pending, dalfampridine can be regarded as efficient medication for a long-term improvement of functionality in daily living and quality of life.",

"Abstract": "Objectives: Approximately one in two patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from comorbid depression. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fingolimod and antidepressant combination in relapsing-remitting MS patients with mild-to-moderate depression. Efficacy outcome variables were quality of life (QoL), fatigue, disability and depression. Methods: Patients received open-label fingolimod 0.5 mg over 2 weeks, followed by fingolimod plus citalopram (40 mg), fluoxetine (40 mg) or venlafaxine (150 mg) over 16 weeks. The antidepressant was selected at the physician's discretion. Results: In total, 54 patients were recruited at 25 centres across Germany. No new safety signals (including cardiac) emerged compared with previous clinical studies. Adverse events (mostly mild-to-moderate) were reported in 43 patients. A total of three patients had serious adverse events and 10 discontinued the study. QoL (mean [95% confidence interval]) improved by 2.2 ('3.3, '1.2; Patient Reported Indices for MS questionnaire), fatigue by 8.2 ('13.1, '3.3; modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and depression by 6.3 ('8.4, '4.2; Hamilton Depression Scale) points. However, the results must be interpreted cautiously owing to limited patient numbers. Conclusions: Combination of fingolimod with antidepressant medication showed no unexpected safety signals. Patient-reported outcomes (QoL, disability, fatigue and depression) remained stable or improved.",

"Abstract": "Histamine has a long history of therapeutic use in many diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, transdermal histamine has been successfully employed for the amelioration of symptoms of both relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis. This paper summarizes preliminary experiences with transdermal histamine for MS at the Tahoma Clinic: 67 percent of 55 patients using histamine transdermal cream had improvements in one or more areas, including extremity strength, balance, bladder control, fatigue, activities of daily living, and cognitive functioning, sustained for periods of up to three months. One-third of patients had improvements in three or more areas of functioning. Five possible mechanisms of action are postulated: augmentation of subnormal cerebral tissue levels of histamine; improved electrical function of demyelinated fibers; increased cerebral blood flow; suppression of autoimmune responses; and stimulation of remyelination. These will be discussed in detail in Part 2 of this article.",

"Title": "Duloxetine Is effective in treating depression in multiple sclerosis patients: An open-label multicenter study",
"Abstract": "Objectives: Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for its therapeutic efficacy, safety, and tolerability in the treatment of depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Lifetime depression prevalence approaches 50% in MS patients. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of duloxetine for treatment of depression in MS patients. Methods: An open-label study evaluated the efficacy of 12 weeks of duloxetine administration (maximal dose = 60 mg/d) in MS patients with clinical depression. The Beck scale score variation after 4 (T1) and 12 (T2) weeks of treatment was used for the primary outcome measurement, whereas secondary outcome was measured using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. Safety was evaluated by recording treatment-related adverse events, monitoring vital signs, and recording frequency and reasons for interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Results: Seventy-five patients were enrolled in the study. Sixty-three patients completed the study by continuing duloxetine treatment for 12 weeks (T2). Twelve subjects dropped out of the study because of adverse effects or noncompliance. Nausea was the most common adverse event reported. A significant reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale scores, after both 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, was observed. Conclusions: The results suggest that duloxetine is well tolerated, safe, and effective in reducing depression and fatigue in MS patients.

"Abstract": "Objective: To assess the longterm effects of PR-fampridine in clinical practice. Background: In July 2011 PR-fampridine received conditional EU approval for improvement of walking in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who have walking disability (EDSS 4-7). Two phase III clinical trials with 9- to 14-weeks of treatment demonstrated 38% responders to PR-fampridine by significant walking improvements (e.g. walking speed). Methods: MS patients with walking impairment received PRfampridine 10mg twice daily. At baseline and after 4 weeks patients were assessed for: effects and AE's of treatment, relapse(s), disease progression, concomitant treatments, EDSS, T25FW, MSWS-12, Health-related QoL EQ-5D and Fatigue Severity. Response to PR-fampridine was defined by assessment of the clinical meaningfulness of the patient self-reported outcome after 4 weeks of treatment; in responders, all endpoints were also assessed at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. T25FW was video-taped for all patients at all timepoints. Results: 67 consecutive MS patients (69% female; mean age 47.8 yrs; mean MS duration 16.5 yrs; disease course: 24% RR, 52% SP, 24% PP; mean EDSS 4.8; current treatments: 51% DMT's, 52% antispastic drugs, 63% rehab therapy) began treatment with PR-fampridine. After 4 weeks 22/67 (32.8%) and 34/67 (50.7%) patients responded by a = 20% and = 10%, respectively, improvement in walking speed (T25FW) relative to baseline. Based on walking quality 44/67 (65.7%) patients responded to PR-fampridine. Responders reported improvement within 2 weeks after baseline. Completed 6-month evaluations showed sustained improvements in walking quality (40/67, 59.7%) and walking speed (= 20%: 11/67, 16.4%; = 10%: 26/67, 38.8%). EDSS remained stable in reponders (mean EDSS at 6 months: 4.8). Fatigue (assessed in 38 patients) also improved: mean score decreased by 1.0 point, from 5.2 at baseline to 4.2 after 6 months. 3/67 (4.5%) discontinued PR-fampridine due to AE's (nausea, insomnia). Assessments at months 9 and 12 will be completed. Conclusions: The conditional EU approval for PR-fampridine acknowledges the unmet need for symptomatic treatment of MS patients with walking disability. PR-fampridine in daily clinical practice mirrors the results of the pivotal phase III trials and demonstrates a sustained improvement in walking over time. Thus, the beneficial effect of PR-fampridine is clinically meaningful in daily life for a significant percentage of MS patients with walking impairment.",

"Abstract": "Objective.- To assess efficacy of fampridine on walking parameters, hand function, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods.- Hundred and eleven consecutive patients eligible for fampridine treatment were evaluated before and after 2 weeks (W2) of treatment, and finally after 3 months (M3) for responders. Response criteria were defined as an improvement of at least 15% in the Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW), the 2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) or the MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12). Moreover, we performed an analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters (GAITRITE), and assessments of fatigue (Visual Analog Scale (VAS), hand function (Nine Hole Peg Test) and QoL (SF-12). Results.- Eighty-five patients (76.6%) were found to be responders, improving T25FW by 33.6% at W2 (vs 4.8% in non-responders) and 31.8% at M3, 2MWT by 38.4% (vs8.5%) and 35.6% and MSWS by 18%. Furthermore, responders showed an amelioration of fatigue severity (P < 0.01), hand function (P < 0.05) and QoL (P < 0.001). Discussion.- In responders, fampridine improveswalking, but also other general symptoms and QoL. It could be of interest in the rehabilitation of MS patients.",

"Title": "Impact of fampridine on fatigue, depression and cognition in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Fatigue and depression are independent predictors of life quality in MS. Fatigue is a main reason for invalidity and early retirement. Cognitive dysfunctions cause substantial occupational and social problems in patients with MS. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of fampridine on fatigue, depression and cognition in patients with MS. Methods: 117 patients (82 women, 35 mean, median age 50.1 years) of the MS centre Dresden were examined. The initial investigation (V0) was followed by taking fampridine for 14 days with a second investigation (V1) for analysis of treatment effects afterwards. Qualitative parameters for fatigue, depression and cognition (Weimus, ADS-L, PASAT) were collected. Results: 87 patients (74.4%) were classified as responders, 30 patients (25.6%) as non-responders. At V0, nonresponders showed significantly higher values for physical (p=0.009*), cognitive (p=0.048*) and total fatigue (p=0.012*). No significant differences were evident for ADS-L (p=0.101) and PASAT (p=0.378) at V0. At V1, differences between responder and non-responder groups concerning physical (p<0.001*), cognitive (p<0.001*) and total fatigue (p<0.001*) had increased. Depression also differed significantly between both groups (p<0.001*), whereas no differences for PASAT (p=0.935) emerged. Analysis of variance revealed significantly different changes between groups over time concerning all fatigue dimensions (p<0.001*, respectively) and depression (p=0.001*). Conclusion: Responders and non-responders of fampridine therapy do not just differ regarding motor-related outcomes. Responders additionally benefit concerning cognitive and physical fatigue as well as depression, while non-responders show no change in these dimensions. Cognitive function does not seem to be influenced by fampridine.",

"Title": "Sustained-released fampridine in multiple sclerosis: effects on gait parameters, arm function, fatigue, and quality of life",
"Abstract": "Sustained-release fampridine (fampridine-SR) improves gait velocity and self-perceived capacities in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about the treatment's effect on temporospatial gait parameters, walking endurance, general fatigue, hand function and quality of life (QoL). We therefore sought to evaluate these parameters in a real-world setting: 120 consecutive, eligible patients with MS were evaluated at baseline (D0) and after two weeks (D14) of fampridine-SR. Lastly, D14 responders were again evaluated after three months (M3). Response to treatment was defined as a 15% improvement in at least one of the following tests: the Timed 25-Foot-Walk (T25FW), the 2-min walk test (2MWT) and the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12). Eighty-three patients (74%) were found to be responders. The response rate was lower when assessed as a 20% improvement in the T25FW (50.9%), and this difference was particularly marked for fast-walking subjects (i.e. T25FW <8 s at baseline). Responders displayed mean improvements (at D14 and M3, respectively) of 34.5 and 35.5% in the T25FW, 39 and 36.7% in the 2MWT and 19 and 11.6% in the MSWS-12. The increase in gait velocity was due to both a higher cadence and a greater step length. Responders showed also significant, lasting reductions in fatigue (visual analogue scale and the Fatigue Severity Scale; p < 10(-4) at D14 and <0.01 at M3) and significant, lasting improvements in hand function (9 Hole Peg Test; p < 0.05) and QoL (SF-12; p < 0.01). In conclusion, several MS-induced symptoms other than gait velocity may be improved by fampridine-SR, even if this remains to be more specifically evaluated in future studies.",

"Title": "Dalfampridine improves spasticity and fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue and spasticity are common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) with significant impairment of quality of life. Objectives: Evaluate the short and long-term (6 months) effects of Dalfampridine on spasticity and fatigue. Methods: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data on patients with MS. The effect of Dalfampridine was assessed at 14 days (D14), 3 months (3M) and 6 months (6M) of treatment with the T25FWT as an objective measure of the walking speed. Fatigue was measured using the validated french questionnaire EMIF-SEP and spasticity with a validated numerical rating scale (NRS). A Friedman test was used for multiple comparisons and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for 2X2 comparisons. Differences were considered significant at an alpha level of p< 0.05. Results: Between April 2013 and March 2014, 134 patients (age (mean Ã‚Â± sd): 54 Ã‚Â± 18.6 years; median EDSS: 6) having benefited from Dalfampridine were evaluated at D14. At 6 months, 104 patients were evaluated and continue Dalfampridine. The following results are from the 104 patients evaluated at 6 months. Between baseline and D14, The T25FWT (25.6 Ã‚Â± 42.8 vs 15.5 Ã‚Â± 23.2 sec; p < 0.0001), fatigue (57.6 Ã‚Â± 19.5% vs 37, 8 Ã‚Â± 19%; p < 0.0001) and spasticity (NRS) (5.7 Ã‚Â± 2.4 vs 3.9 Ã‚Â± 2; p < 0.0001) decreased significantly. For all assessment criteria, compared with baseline, the positive effects persisted after 3 month (T25FWT: p< 0.0001; fatigue: p< 0.0001 and spasticity: p< 0.0001) and 6 months (T25FWT: p< 0.0001; fatigue: p< 0.0001 and spasticity: p< 0.001) under Dalfampridine medication. Conclusions: Dalfampridine reduces spasticity and fatigue in MS. Ruck et al., 2013 found a positive effect on fatigue (MFSC) after 14 days of treatment, which lasts 9 and 12 months. Prugger et.al, 2013 shows an effect on fatigue (FSS) only at 6 months. The effect on spasticity has been studied by Goodman et al., 2010 without significant treatment effect on the Ashworth score at 14 days. Improvement in nerve conduction in demyelinated axons associated with decrease in conduction blocks may partially explain the improvement in fatigue and spasticity. Dalfampridine has a positive effect on walking ability, spasticity and fatigue and may participate in the improvement of quality of life.",

"Title": "PR-Fampridine improves walking and quality of life in people with MS related severe walking impairment: A pragmatic observational study",
"Abstract": "Background: Prolonged release Fampridine has been shown to increase walking speed in ~40% of people within 2 weeks of commencing treatment. Consensus deems a 20% increase in walking speed as clinically meaningful. Although licensed widely this is conditional in Europe pending long term outcome and quality of life data. In the UK the drug in not routinely prescribed. Objectives: To assess the effect of PR-Fampridine on walking speed, quality of life and functional goal attainment in peolple with severe MS related walking impairment. Methods: People with a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and persistent walking impairment were identified and assessed in the MS ambulation clinic at the NHNN, London UK. Baseline demographics, clinical disease course, concomitant medication, lower limb power, spasticity, walking aids, timed 25 foot walk (T25FW), Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale 12, EQ5D-5L, VAS (Visual analogue scale) walking and a falls log were completed and functional goal(s) of treatment identified. Those eligible were offered a trial of PR-Fampridine 10 mg BD. Subjects were treated for 2-4 weeks and reassessed. Those with a 20% or more increase in walking speed were deemed responders. Outcome measures, other benefits and side effects were recorded at each visit and goal attainment at 3 months. Results: 137 subjects were assessed of whom 76 were deemed eligible for trial of PR-Fampridine. Mean age 55, 61% female, mean EDSS 6.3. To date 56 subjects have completed a treatment trial, 39 (69%) were deemed responders (20% increase in walking speed). Responders walking speed increased from 0.8 ft/s to 1.2 ft/s (50% increase) vs 0.94ft/s non-responders (p < 0.001). MSWS12 scores decreased by 30 points (~33%) in responders vs 17 non-responders (p< 0.001). The EQ5D-5L VAS increased from 53 to 67.5 (27%) (p< 0.001), VAS walking increased from 2.4 to 5.2 on treatment (p< 0.001). Response was sustained during follow up. Subjects achieved many of their identified goals of treatment and reported reduced fatigue, improved spasticity and memory. Conclusions: In this cohort with severe MS related walking impairment PR-Fampridine is a useful adjunct improving speed and quality of gait and quality of life measures-EQ5D-5L and VAS walking in clinical responders. In this severely affected cohort the proportion of responders was higher than in clinical trials. Providing an ambulation service also offers non-responders alternative treatments to improve gait and is an excellent model to meet complex care needs.",

"Title": "Levocarnitine administration in multiple sclerosis patients with immunosuppressive therapy-induced fatigue",
"Abstract": "Nutritional factors and comedications are among the postulated causes of fatigue, a highly prevalent symptom in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population, with serious impact on patients' quality of life. Deficiency of carnitine may play a role by reducing energy production through fatty acid oxidation and numerous MS therapies can induce fatigue syndrome. The aim of this prospective open-labelled study was to collect and study serum carnitine levels in MS patients with and without disease-modifying treatment-induced fatigue syndrome. We investigated whether restoration of the carnitine pool might improve treatment-induced fatigue in MS patients. In our study, there was no statistical difference in fatigue frequency between treated and untreated patients (P=0.5). Matched to age, gender and treatments, carnitine levels were lower for MS treated patients compared to untreated MS patients (P <0.05) or controls (P <0.001). Consecutive patients with low plasma carnitine levels who experienced fatigue were substituted. Treatment consisted of oral levocarnitine, 3-6 g daily. All patients achieved normal plasma carnitine levels. For 63% of patients treated with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies, oral levocarnitine adjunction decreased fatigue intensity, especially in patients treated with cyclophosphamide and interferon beta.",

"Title": "Worsening of trigeminal neuralgia by dalfampridine in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Dalfampridine is an inhibitor of the voltage dependent potassium channel which enhances conduction of action potentials in demyelinating axons. The treatment is approved in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with impaired ambulation owing to its positive effect on walking speed. Additional studies support that it may also improve vision, fatigue, and tremor. However, a recent study suggests that it may worsen neuropathic pain in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Aims: The aim of our study was to determine the effect of dalfampridine- extended release (ER) on multiple parameters including ambulation, fatigue, visual functions, and neuropathic pain. We also tried to ascertain the previously proposed detrimental effect in patients with TN. Methods: In this study, we collected data from MS patients who were prescribed dalfampridine-ER during their management. Patients were retrospectively questioned about the efficacy of the treatment and adverse effects. Patients with TN were analyzed separately. Results: A total of 179 patients (109 female, 70 male) were included in the study. Most of the patients (72.1%) had progressive course. Mean treatment duration was 20.7Ã‚Â±14,2 months (Ã‚Â±standard deviation). Mean EDSS of the patients was 5,8Ã‚Â±0,8. The proportion of patients who reported an improvement in ambulation and fatigue were 69.3% and 49.2% respectively. There was no subjective improvements in vision, diplopia or neuropathic pain. Additionally, we detected 7 patients with TN. Three of them reported worsening of pain after commencing dalfampridine treatment. Furthermore, TN started de novo in one patient during the treatment. All of the three patients reported an improvement of their TN after discontinuation of dalfampridine. Conclusions: This study suggests that there may be a detrimental effect of dalfampridine in MS patients with TN. This may partially be associated with enhancement of neural transmission by increasing synaptic neurotransmitter release. Before starting dalfampridine, this adverse effect should be taken into consideration in patients with TN.",

"Title": "Evaluating the effects of amantadine, modafinil, fatigue management programme and acetyl L carnitine on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Fatigue occurs in more than 60% of MS patients and nearly half of the patients describe it as the most disabling symptom of the disease. It has a major impact on quality of life on MS patients. Current treatment options for MS fatigue include amantadine, modafinil and acetyl L carnitine (ALCAR) and fatigue management program (FMP). The aim of our study was to compare efficacy of amantadine, modafinil, ALCAR and FMP with placebo in patients with MS. Methods: Patients with MS and a disability level = 6,5 on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and fatigue were included in the study. Patients were assigned to a one month treatment with either amantadine 200 mg, ALCAR 2g, modafinil 200 mg, FMP or placebo.

"Title": "Amantadine treatment of fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Fatigue is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is without an effective treatment. A double-blind, controlled study of fatigue treatment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of amantadine hydrochloride in treating MS-associated fatigue. Since fatigue cannot be characterized by a single symptom or behavior, a variety of neuropsychological, behavioral, and self-report measures were used to monitor changes across different systems. According to patients' daily diary ratings, amantadine produced small but statistically significant improvements in fatigue across four of seven dimensions (overall energy level, concentration, problem solving, and sense of well-being). In addition, patients with MS who were taking amantadine performed slightly better on the Stroop Interference Test, an attentional measure of freedom from distracting information. Although retrospective reports by patients with MS did not confirm the degree of improvement recorded on a daily basis, the study's results suggested that amantadine may offer modest benefits in alleviating the day-to-day subjective experience of fatigue.",

"Title": "A double-blind pilot study of the effect of Prokarin on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "UNLABELLED: In this 12-week study with 29 subjects, the effect of Prokarin (n=22), a proprietary blend of histamine and caffeine, was compared to placebo group (n=7) for the following outcomes: 1) fatigue as measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS); 2) lower limb function as measured by timed walk test; 3) upper limb function as measured by the pegboard test; 4) cognitive function as measured by the Paced Auditory Serial Additions Test (PASAT); 5) serum caffeine level; 6) change in brain chemistry as measured by quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy assay of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA); and 7) safety as measured by routine blood chemistry, TSH and urinalysis. Data were acquired at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The Prokarin group MFIS mean was significantly different rom the mean of the placebo group at 12 weeks (df=24, t=2.08, P=<0.02), with respective means of 37.40, SD=15.18, for the Prokarin group and 53.2, SD=11.39 for the controls. For the secondary endpoints (PASAT, 25 foot timed walk, peg test, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]), there were no significant differences between the Prokarin-treated group and the placebo group. However, there were significant improvements within the Prokarin group for each of these measures for the pre- versus posttreatment comparison at 12 weeks. Serum caffeine data indicated that caffeine exerted no independent effect on performance. No laboratory abnormalities were seen, and the treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: There was a modest-size statistical effect of Prokarin on fatigue in multiple sderosis (MS) compared with the placebo group. A larger trial is warranted, based on this pilot study.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of modafinil for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of MS, a stable disability level < or =6 on the Kurtzke extended disability status scale (EDSS), and a mean score >4 on the fatigue severity scale (FSS) were eligible for the 9 week, single blind, phase 2, two centre study. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnoea, or clinically significant major systemic disease and recent use of medications affecting fatigue. All patients, who remained blinded for the treatment regimen, received placebo during weeks 1-2, 200 mg/day modafinil during weeks 3-4, 400 mg/day modafinil during weeks 5-6, and placebo during weeks 7-9. Safety was evaluated by unblinded investigators. Efficacy was evaluated by self rating scales, using the FSS, the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), a visual analogue scale for fatigue (VAS-F), and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy two patients (MS type: 74% relapsing-remitting; 7% primary progressive; 19% secondary progressive) received treatment. After treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil for 2 weeks, a significant improvement in fatigue versus placebo run in was demonstrated. Mean scores after treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil were: FSS, 4.7 versus 5.5 for placebo (p<0.001); MFIS, 37.7 versus 44.7 (p<0.001); and VAS-F, 5.4 versus 4.5 (p=0.003). Fatigue scores for 400 mg/day modafinil were not significantly improved versus placebo run in. Mean ESS scores were significantly improved (p<0.001) with 200 mg/day modafinil (7.2) and 400 mg/day (7.0) versus the score at baseline (9.5). Serious adverse events were not found at either dose. The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and aesthenia. Sixty five patients (90%) completed the study. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 200 mg/day modafinil significantly improves fatigue and is well tolerated in patients with MS.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of 4-aminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyridine in patients with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Intervention study with a before-after design and a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. SETTING: University referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with definite multiple sclerosis who had been treated in a previous clinical trial with 4-aminopyridine. INTERVENTIONS: Nonresponders to treatment with 4-aminopyridine (14 patients) were treated with 3,4-diaminopyridine in a 4-week, open-label trial with doses up to 1.0 mg/kg of body weight (before-after design). Responders to treatment with 4-aminopyridine (10 patients) participated in a comparative study of 6 weeks' duration with 4-aminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyridine according to a randomized, double-blind, double-crossover design. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurophysiologic variables for nonresponders, neurologic functions and symptoms on a visual analogue scale for responders, and side effects for both groups. RESULTS: Toxicity profiles of 4-aminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyridine were different, and systemic tolerability was reduced for 3,4-diaminopyridine. 4-Aminopyridine was more effective than 3,4-diaminopyridine, especially for ambulation, fatigue, and overall daily functioning. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, concerning both efficacy and side effects, 4-aminopyridine is superior to 3,4-diaminopyridine in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.",

"Abstract": "Treatment with acetyl L-carnitine (ALCAR) has been shown to improve fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, but there have been no trials on the effect of ALCAR for treating fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). To compare the efficacy of ALCAR with that of amantadine, one of the drugs most widely used to treat MS-related fatigue, 36 MS patients presenting fatigue were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study. Patients were treated for 3 months with either amantadine (100 mg twice daily) or ALCAR (1 g twice daily). After a 3-month washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 3 months. Patients were rated at baseline and every 3 months according to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary outcome variables were: Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Social Experience Checklist (SEC). Six patients withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions (five on amantadine and one on ALCAR). Statistical analysis showed significant effects of ALCAR compared with amantadine for the Fatigue Severity Scale (p = 0.039). There were no significant effects for any of the secondary outcome variables. The results of this study show that ALCAR is better tolerated and more effective than amantadine for the treatment of MS-related fatigue.",

"Title": "Fatigue in multiple sclerosis: multidimensional assessment and response to symptomatic treatment",
"Abstract": "Sixty relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were selected on the basis of their score on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and formed two groups: 40 patients (fatigued MS; MSf) scored above the 75th percentile of a previously assessed representative MS sample (100 patients), and 20 age- and sex-matched patients (nonfatigued MS patients; MSnf) scored below the 25th percentile. The patients underwent clinical evaluation (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)), further assessment of fatigue (Fatigue Impact Scale), scales evaluating depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI)) and neuropsychological tests. All patients were evaluated for muscle fatigability and central activation by means of a biomechanical test of sustained contraction; they also underwent somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The patients of the MSf subgroup were then randomized to one of the following two treatments: 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) 24 mg/day and fluoxetine (FLX) 20 mg/day. After a one-week titration this treatment proceeded for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, EDSS, fatigue and depression scores were further evaluated. At baseline, fatigue test scores consistently correlated with depression and cognitive test scores, but not with the fatigability test. Fatigue scores decreased in both treatment groups in a similar way. Due to the design of the study, this cannot be disjoined from a placebo effect. The changes of fatigue scores could not be predicted in the FLX group, whereas in the 4-AP group higher basal fatigability test scores were associated with greater reduction in fatigue scores.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and amantadine for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A 10-week, randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial conducted from October 2009 to September 2010. Fifty-two patients with MS presenting fatigue at 21 to 53 years of age were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. The first group received amantadine (100 mg twice daily) for a total of 4 weeks. The second group received ASA (500 mg once daily) for four weeks. After a 2-week washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 4 weeks. Patients were rated at baseline and the end of each phase with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: ASA appeared to be equivalent in efficacy and safety to amantadine. A significant decrease in FSS occurred in both groups. Of the 26 patients treated with amantadine, the mean (SD) of FSS decreased from 4Ã‚Â·8 (1Ã‚Â·4) to 4Ã‚Â·0 (1Ã‚Â·4) (P<0Ã‚Â·001). In the 26 patients treated with ASA, the mean (SD) of FSS decreased from 4Ã‚Â·6 (1Ã‚Â·4) to 3Ã‚Â·5 (1Ã‚Â·5) (P<0Ã‚Â·001). DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that both ASA and amantadine significantly reduce MS-related fatigue. Both ASA and amantadine have previously been shown to reduce fatigue, and we postulate that treatment with ASA and amantadine may have similar benefits.",

"Abstract": "Purpose/Objective: To assess the efficacy of modafinil for the treatment of new learning and memory deficits and fatigue in multiple sclerosis. Only 1 previous study in the literature, to our knowledge, examined the effect of modafinil on cognition specifically in persons with multiple sclerosis. Research Method/Design: Sixteen patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and documented new learning impairment completed the study. In a 5-week randomized, double-blinded, crossover design, participants received either a single daily oral dose of modafinil (200 mg) or placebo for 2 weeks. A 1-week washout period was included between study arms. Results: No effect of modafinil was noted on learning and memory performance. Participants taking 200 mg of modafinil showed improvement in 1 of the 2 working memory measures administered, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) Letter-Number Sequencing task, as compared with those on placebo. Treatment with modafinil did not have a beneficial effect in reducing self-reported fatigue. No changes were noted on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale or the Fatigue Severity Scale with the treatment of modafinil, as compared with placebo. Conclusions/Implications: Findings indicate that 200 mg of modafinil has the potential to improve working memory in persons with MS. These findings suggest that modafinil may enhance aspects of cognition in persons with MS and may be an effective adjunct to clinical rehabilitation interventions.

"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects of Modafinil on focused attention, motor function and motor excitability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and fatigue. METHODS: 21 MS patients with fatigue were enrolled in this double-blind placebo-controlled study. Modafinil (MOD) or placebo (PL) was administered for 8 weeks. The d2 alertness test, the Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT) and several transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques were applied prior to and after the first drug ingestion and well as after 8 weeks of drug intake. RESULTS: Prior to the first drug intake, the two groups were comparable. After the first drug ingestion, fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), performance of the d2 test and the 9HPT improved significantly in the MOD group and remained better than in the PL group after 8 weeks of treatment. Patients in the MOD group made fewer mistakes in the D2 test without being slower. They completed the 9HPT faster. Motor evoked potential amplitudes produced by paired pulse TMS were larger in the MOD group than the PL group. Motor thresholds and silent period durations remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to PL, MOD improved fatigue, focused attention and dexterity and enhanced motor cortex excitability in this group of patients. MOD may be helpful in MS patients with fatigue to improve cognitive and motor abilities.",

They were randomized to receive escalating doses, from 10mg bid to a maximum of 30mg bid, of oral methylphenidate or matched placebo. Walking, balance, cognition, and fatigue were assessed at baseline and at dose escalation every 2 weeks. Changes in measures were compared between groups using a Bayesian approach. Results: At baseline the groups were well matched on all outcomes, with an overall mean age of 49 and median EDSS of 4.5. Overall, performance improved on most measures over time, with greater improvements in the placebo group than in the methylphenidate group. Specifically for mobility, Timed Up and Go: in placebo 12.9 seconds (s) at baseline to 10.3s at week 6, methylphenidate 13.2s to 12.3s; Timed 25 Foot Walk: in placebo 8.4s to 6.7s, methylphenidate 8.8s to 8.7s; Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale: in placebo 58.8 to 63.8, methylphenidate 56.3 to 53.2; Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12: in placebo 42.8 to 42.2, methylphenidate 45.4 to 44.9. For cognition, Symbol Digit Modality Test: placebo 52.4 to 61.3, methylphenidate 47.0 to 46.8. For fatigue, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale: placebo 42.8 to 30.5, methylphenidate 41.4 to 33.7. Conclusions: Although limited by small sample size, this study suggests that methylphenidate up to 30mg bid is likely less effective than placebo for improving mobility, cognition or fatigue in MS.",

"Title": "Fatigue and sleepiness in multiple sclerosis: Effect of modafinil",
"Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifocal demyelinatingdisease of the central nervous system, leading tochronic disability. Fatigue is a common symptom ofMS (1). Fatigue has been defined as Ã¢â‚¬Å“subjective lackof physical and/or mental energy that is perceived tointerfere with usual and desired activitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â (2). MSpatients rate fatigue as one of their worst symptoms,interfering with their quality of life and leading todisability (1, 3). Fatigue in MS can be associated withexcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) (4). Therefore, itis of interest that the wakefulness-promoting drugmodafinil, licensed for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy(5), has been reported to relieve fatigue inMS (6). However, the efficacy of modafinil in MSfatigue has not been universally confirmed (7). Weexamined whether patients with fatigue show an increasedsusceptibility to the wakefulness-promotingand sympathetic-activating effects of a single doseof modafinil (5), compared to MS patients withoutfatigue and healthy controls.Three groups of subjects (age [mean Ã‚Â± SD]:43.7 Ã‚Â± 10.8 years), matched for age, were recruited:1. MS patients with fatigue (12 females, 5 males),2. MS patients with no fatigue (5 females, 4 males),3. healthy controls (5 females, 4 males). MS patientswere selected using two clinical fatigue rating scales:the Fatigue Assessment Instrument and the FatigueSeverity Score (FSS) (3). MS patients allocated toGroup 1 had FSS scores in excess of 4.1, and thoseallocated to Group 2 had FSS scores less than 2.9.After an initial induction session, the subjects received,double-blind, a single dose (200 mg) of modafinil inone session and placebo in another session; the orderof sessions was randomized. Tests of alertness includedsubjective ratings (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, StanfordSleepiness Scale, Battery of Visual Analogue Scales),instrumental measurements (critical flicker fusionfrequency [CFFF], Pupillographic Sleepiness Test[PST]) (5), and psychomotor tests (Choice ReactionTime [CRT], Digit Cancellation Time, Speech PauseTime). Autonomic tests included pupillary measures(pupil diameter in darkness and light, light reflex,darkness reflex) and cardiovascular measures (bloodpressure and heart rate, sitting; blood pressure andheart rate response to isometric handgrip) (5, 8).Measurements were taken before and two hours aftertreatment. Data were analysed with analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) with multiple comparisons (leastsignificant difference test): criterion p = 0.05.At baseline level (prior to treatment), Group 1 wasless alert than Group 3 (Epworth and Stanford Scales,VAS, CFFF), and showed some psychomotor slowing(elongated motor response time on CRT test).There were no significant differences between thebaseline autonomic functions of the three groups.However, the increase in diastolic blood pressure toisometric handgrip, a test of sympathetic activation(8), showed a significant difference. The frequency ofnormal response in Group 1 (34%) was lower thanthat in Group 2 (67%; p = 0.05) or Group 3 (59%; 0.05= p = 0.1) (?(2) test).Modafinil displayed alerting and sympathomimeticeffects in all three groups. The alerting effectwas evidenced as decreases in pupillary sleepinesswaves in the PST, shortening of the motor responsetime in the CRT test, and enhancement of the CFFF.The sympathomimetic effect appeared as increases inpupil diameter, systolic and diastolic blood pressureand heart rate. There were no significant differences between the effects of modafinil in MS patients andhealthy control subjects.The present results demonstrate that, in contrastwith MS patients who do not suffer from fatigue, MSpatients with fatigue scored low on laboratory measuresof alertness, confirming a close link betweenthe clinical symptoms of fatigue and EDS. As thereis a close association between the neural controls ofarousal and sympathetic activity (9), it is not surprisingthat MS patients with fatigue also showedevidence of impaired sympathetic activation by theisometric hand-grip test. Indeed, it has been proposedthat sympathetic dysfunction may be a hallmark of fatiguein MS patients (10). The present results confirmthe alerting and sympathetic-activating effects of modafinil(5), and support the view that the therapeuticefficacy of modafinil in MS may be largely related tothe alleviation of EDS (11).An interesting, and hitherto unanswered, questionis why so many MS patients suffer from fatigue/EDS,irrespective of the topography of the focal demyelinatinglesions, the total plaque load on magneticresonance imaging, or the stage of progression ofthe disease. It is an intriguing possibility that thedevelopment of fatigue/EDS in MS may reflect damageto the central noradrenergic nucleus, the locuscoeruleus, as has been demonstrated recently (12).The locus coeruleus is known to be crucial for themaintenance of arousal and sympathetic activity, andits compromised function is known to lead to reducedlevel of alertness and sympathetic activity (9).Furthermore, modafinil, acting mainly indirectly viathe dopaminergic system, is a powerful activator ofthe locus coeruleus, and thus is able to attenuate theadverse consequences of reduced central noradrenergicfunction.",

"Abstract": "Pharmacotherapeutic options for multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue are limited. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to aspirin (ASA) 1,300 mg/day or placebo in a double-blind crossover study. Results favored ASA for the main clinical outcomes: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale scores (p = 0.043) and treatment preference (p = 0.012). There were no significant adverse effects. The results warrant further study and support a role for ASA-influenced mechanisms, perhaps immunologic, in the generation of MS-related chronic fatigue.",

"Title": "Impact of armodafinil on cognition in multiple sclerosis: A randomized, double-blind crossover pilot study",
"Abstract": "Objective: Examine the efficacy of armodafinil in improving cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Background: Many patients with MS experience cognitive difficulties. Armodafinil has shown promise as a cognitive enhancer in other patient populations. No studies have examined whether armodafinil improves cognition in patients with MS. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study testing the efficacy of armodafinil in reducing cognitive problems in patients with MS. We randomized 17 patients to receive a dose of lactose placebo about 2 hours before they underwent a neuropsychological testing session. After a week-long washout period, we gave them a single 250-mg dose of armodafinil about 2 hours before testing them a second time. We randomized another 16 patients to receive the active drug first, then the placebo. We excluded 3 of the participants before analyzing the data. Results: After correcting for multiple comparisons of the 8 neuropsychological dependent measures, we found that the patients had significantly improved delayed memory on a list-learning task after they took armodafinil (P = 0.0005), but no improvement on measures of executive function, visual memory, processing speed, or self-reported fatigue. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary evidence that armodafinil may improve delayed verbal recall in patients with MS. A larger trial showing enhanced memory among patients taking long-term armodafinil could serve as a foundation for its possible clinical use as a memory enhancer in patients with MS.

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety of sustained-release 4-aminopyridine in subjects with mutiple sclerosis (MS) and to examine dose-related efficacy up to 40 mg twice daily. METHOD: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study. Following a 4-week baseline peroid, subjects were randomly assigned to receive Fampridine-SR (n=25, doses from 10 to 40 mg twice daily, increasing in 5 mg increments weekly) or placebo (n=11). A battery of assessments was performed weekly, including the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), fatigue questionnaires, and lower extremity manual muscle testing. RESULTS: The most common adverse events were dizziness, insomnia, paresthesia, asthenia, nausea, headache, and tremor. Five subjects were discontinued from Fampridine-SR because of adverse events at doses greater than 25 mg, and these included convulsions in two subjects at doses of 30 and 35 mg twice daily. Improvement were seen in lower extremity muscle strength (prospective analysis) and walking speed (post-hoc analysis) in the Fampridine-SR group compared to placebo (unadjusted p-values of 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). There were no significant differences in other MSFC measure or fatigue scores. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should employ doses up to 20 mg twice daily with lower extremity strength and walking speed as potential outcome measures.",

"Abstract": "Treatment with acetyl L-carnitine (ALCAR) has been shown to improve fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, but there have been no trials on the effect of ALCAR for treating fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). To compare the efficacy of ALCAR with that of amantadine, one of the drugs most widely used to treat MS-related fatigue, 36 MS patients presenting fatigue were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study. Patients were treated for 3 months with either amantadine (100 mg twice daily) or ALCAR (1 g twice daily). After a 3-month washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 3 months. Patients were rated at baseline and every 3 months according to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary outcome variables were: Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Social Experience Checklist (SEC). Six patients withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions (five on amantadine and one on ALCAR). Statistical analysis showed significant effects of ALCAR compared with amantadine for the Fatigue Severity Scale (p = 0.039). There were no significant effects for any of the secondary outcome variables. The results of this study show that ALCAR is better tolerated and more effective than amantadine for the treatment of MS-related fatigue.",

"Title": "Prolonged-release fampridine and active motor training in MS patients: A Phase IV, double-blind, placebo-controlled",
"Abstract": "Introduction: Prolonged-release fampridine (PRF) has been shown in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to improve walking capabilities by more than 20% in approximately 34% of subjects. Active motor training in MS patients is both feasible and beneficial. Studies have shown it to improve walking ability, fatigue, depressive symptoms and cognition. The objective of our study is to test the hypothesis that active motor training when combined with PRF in patients with MS will produce a larger and more sustained measurable clinical benefit than with active motor training alone. Methods: Phase 4, single center, double-blind placebo-controlled 14 week study. Patients were randomized to receive PRF 10 mg or placebo BID. All patients underwent active motor training as per the NeuroGym method consisting of 3, I hour session, per week for a period of 6 weeks (total of 18 sessions). Patients were evaluated at times -4, 0, 6, and 14 weeks using the timed 8 meter walk (T8MW), the six minute walk (6MW) and the Five-Times-Sit-to- Stand (FTSST).A responder was defined as a patient who improved more than 20% from baseline in a specific task and time point. Mean percent improvement was measured for the whole group (PRF or placebo) for a task and time point. Results: 37 patients completed the study. There were no statistical difference between the two groups at baseline. A measurable benefit was noted from the training in both groups which was sustained at week 14. The greatest improvement in both groups was noted in the sit to stand measure with an OR of 2.7 (p=0.13) of being a responder in the PRF treated group. The incidence of responders was higher in the PRF treated group and ranged from 22 to 66% ( p =0.1 or more) The PRF treated group showed a higher mean percent improvement in all three measurements at both time points but this did not reach statistical significance. (p values ranging from 0.07 to 0.4) Conclusions: MS patients can obtain a sustained benefit from strength training. PRF appears to increase the degree of improvement at both the individual and the group level. The latter will need to be confirmed in a larger trial.",

"Title": "Fatigue in multiple sclerosis: multidimensional assessment and response to symptomatic treatment",
"Abstract": "Sixty relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were selected on the basis of their score on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and formed two groups: 40 patients (fatigued MS; MSf) scored above the 75th percentile of a previously assessed representative MS sample (100 patients), and 20 age- and sex-matched patients (nonfatigued MS patients; MSnf) scored below the 25th percentile. The patients underwent clinical evaluation (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)), further assessment of fatigue (Fatigue Impact Scale), scales evaluating depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI)) and neuropsychological tests. All patients were evaluated for muscle fatigability and central activation by means of a biomechanical test of sustained contraction; they also underwent somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The patients of the MSf subgroup were then randomized to one of the following two treatments: 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) 24 mg/day and fluoxetine (FLX) 20 mg/day. After a one-week titration this treatment proceeded for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, EDSS, fatigue and depression scores were further evaluated. At baseline, fatigue test scores consistently correlated with depression and cognitive test scores, but not with the fatigability test. Fatigue scores decreased in both treatment groups in a similar way. Due to the design of the study, this cannot be disjoined from a placebo effect. The changes of fatigue scores could not be predicted in the FLX group, whereas in the 4-AP group higher basal fatigability test scores were associated with greater reduction in fatigue scores.",

"Title": "The Effects of modified-release fampridine on upper limb impairment in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Modified-release 4-aminopyridine (fampridine- MR) is used as symptomatic treatment of walking disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Its potential for use in other MS symptoms remains unproven and its mode of action in this context is uncertain. Hypotheses: (1) Fampridine-MR improves upper limb function in patients with MS and upper limb impairment. (2) Treatment with fampridine-MR is associated with measurable alterations in objective electrophysiological parameters (evoked potentials and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)) Methods: Study population: patients with MS of any disease subtype, duration and severity who have symptomatic impairment of one or both upper limbs. Article Citation: randomised double blind placebo-controlled trial. Treatment details: participants allocated to either fampridine-MR 10mg bd or placebo of identical appearance for 8 weeks. Primary outcome: performance on 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Secondary outcomes: grip strength; visual acuity and contrast sensitivity; modified fatigue impact scale score; sensory discrimination capacity; visual, somatosensory and motor evoked potentials; resting motor threshold; paired-pulse TMS; peripheral nerve conduction studies. A group of healthy control subjects was included for validation of electrophysiological measures Results: 40 patients with MS (60% female, median age 52, median disease duration 13.5 years, median EDSS 6.0) and 20 healthy controls (60% female, median age 53) were enrolled. Treatment with fampridine was not associated with any effect on upper limb function as measured by the clinical primary or secondary outcomes. Treatment with fampridine was not associated with any measurable difference in the electrophysiological parameters tested. This held true after adjustment for hand dominance, disease duration and severity. 4 patients withdrew from the trial because of lack of efficacy or side-effects; all were in the placebo arm. Three patients were admitted to hospital during the study period; one with MS exacerbation (placebo), one with syncope (drug) and one with UTI (drug); otherwise there were no serious adverse events. Conclusion: Treatment with fampridine was well-tolerated but did not produce clinical benefit for upper limb function, vision or fatigue, nor any measurable effect on electrophysiological parameters.",

"Title": "Efficacy of paroxetine in treating major depressive disorder in persons with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: In this double-blind trial, 42 participants with MS and MDD were randomly assigned to one of two parallel 12-week treatment arms: paroxetine or placebo. The participants started at an initial dose of 10 mg/day paroxetine or placebo, titrated up to 40 mg daily based on symptoms response and side effects. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Secondary outcomes included fatigue, anxiety and self-reported quality of life. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses revealed that both groups improved from pretreatment to posttreatment. Although the treatment group improved more than the control group on most measures, few differences were statistically significant. For the primary outcome, 57.1% of participants in the treatment arm had at least a 50% reduction in HAM-D score, compared with 40% in the control group (nonsignificant). Treatment effects were greater among the participants who completed the study; 78.6% of completers had a treatment response compared with 42.1% of controls (P=.073). CONCLUSION: Although paroxetine may not be efficacious for all persons with MS and MDD, it appears to benefit some individuals.",

"Title": "Does amantadine have favourable effects on fatigue in Persian patients suffering from multiple sclerosis?",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fatigue is a frequent symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), recognized as the most unpleasant symptom by 50-60% of patients. Amantadine is one of the medications prescribed for fatigue in MS. Some previous studies have demonstrated a positive influences of amantadine on fatigue in MS. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of amantadine on Persian MS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study took place in Isfahan, Iran and included 42 MS patients with fatigue who were divided randomly into two groups. Twenty-one patients received amantadine and all others placebo. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was used to determine the severity of the fatigue. FSS scores at baseline and two months later were compared in the two groups. RESULTS: Mean (SD) baseline FSS score was 5.27 (1.11) in the amantadine group and 4.89 (1.13) in the placebo group (p > 0.05). Mean FSS at the end of study was 4.00 (1.02) in the amantadine group and 4.24 (1.03) in the placebo group (p > 0.05); however, the FSS change (the difference between FSS scores at the end of the study and at the beginning of the study) in amantadine and placebo groups was -1.27 (0.53) and -0.66 (0.33), respectively, which was significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a significant drop on the fatigue severity scale in MS patients after treatment with amantadine; nevertheless, more studies on a larger scale with longer duration are needed to confirm this finding.",

"Abstract": "Background: Fatigue is recognized as one of the most disabling and frequent symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Amantadine appears to have some proven ability to alleviate the fatigue in MS. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of co-administration of amantadine and aspirin for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis. Methods: Forty-five ambulatory patients aged 20-50 years with a diagnosis of MS, a stable disability level =6 on the Kurtzke extended disability status scale (EDSS), and a mean score =4 on the fatigue severity scale (FSS) were eligible for the 6 weeks, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study. Efficacy was evaluated by self rating scales, using the FSS. Data analysis was performed by T test, chi-square test, Wilcoxon and ANOVA tests. Results: Amantadine and aspirin treated patients showed a significantly greater reduction in fatigue, as measured by the FSS, than those patients were treated with amantadine and placebo (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that co-administration of amantadine and aspirin was significantly better than amantadine and placebo in treating fatigue in MS patients.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and amantadine for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A 10-week, randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial conducted from October 2009 to September 2010. Fifty-two patients with MS presenting fatigue at 21 to 53 years of age were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. The first group received amantadine (100 mg twice daily) for a total of 4 weeks. The second group received ASA (500 mg once daily) for four weeks. After a 2-week washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 4 weeks. Patients were rated at baseline and the end of each phase with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: ASA appeared to be equivalent in efficacy and safety to amantadine. A significant decrease in FSS occurred in both groups. Of the 26 patients treated with amantadine, the mean (SD) of FSS decreased from 4Ã‚Â·8 (1Ã‚Â·4) to 4Ã‚Â·0 (1Ã‚Â·4) (P<0Ã‚Â·001). In the 26 patients treated with ASA, the mean (SD) of FSS decreased from 4Ã‚Â·6 (1Ã‚Â·4) to 3Ã‚Â·5 (1Ã‚Â·5) (P<0Ã‚Â·001). DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that both ASA and amantadine significantly reduce MS-related fatigue. Both ASA and amantadine have previously been shown to reduce fatigue, and we postulate that treatment with ASA and amantadine may have similar benefits.",

"Title": "Fatigue in progressive multiple sclerosis: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of oral 4-aminopyridine",
"Abstract": "Previous studies suggest that aminopyridine may play a role in the symptomatic treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis. Although the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect on fatigue remains unclear, it has been proposed that aminopyridines may help to improve conduction in demyelinated central pathways, implicating both axonal and synaptic mechanisms. The objective of the present study is to determine whether 4-AP decreases daily-living fatigue in progressive multiple sclerosis. The effect of 4-AP on other neurophysiological and neuropsychological parameters was also considered. A 'double-blind', randomized, 'placebo-controlled', crossover trial was conducted on 54 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. All patients received treatment with placebo and 32 mg per day of 4-AP, each for 6 months. The main outcome measure was the Fatigue Severity Scale. Secondary measures were EDSS, cognitive functions and neurophysiological parameters. Forty-nine patients (91%) completed the study. Changes in fatigue scores, EDSS and cognitive functions were not significantly different between 4-AP and placebo. However, when patients treated with 4-AP were divided into two groups according to the serum level of 4-AP, a significant effect on fatigue compared with placebo was observed in the 'high level' (>30 ng/ml) group (P=0.05). Synchronization of motor evoked potentials improved during 4-AP with respect to placebo (P=0.019) and this correlated positively with fatigue reduction (P=0.010). No relevant side effects were observed.",

"Title": "Results from a randomized double-blind crossover study comparing oral L-carnitine versus placebo for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: There is no validated therapeutic strategy available to date in the treatment of Fatigue in MS. L-carnitine has been studied in some clinical trials but no placebo-controlled randomized study has been conducted to provide a reliable estimation of this drug's effect. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine versus placebo in the treatment of fatigue in patients with MS. Methods: A randomized placebo-controlled multicenter doubleblind crossover study was designed comparing L-carnitine treatment (2g oral solution, twice daily) versus placebo. Over a total of 9 months period, two 3 months periods with trial treatment were separated by a wash-out period of 3 months. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01149525. Eligible MS patients were affected of fatigue for more than 3 months with global score on Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)>45%.The primary outcome measure was the global score on the 21 item MFIS. Secondary outcome measures included the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), physical dimension scale of MFIS, and the SEP59 Quality Of Life scale (derived from the MSQOL-54, validated in French). Free carnitine and acyl-carnitine serum dosages were scheduled at baseline and at the end of study. A mixed linear regression model was used to assess the effect of the treatment and the treatmentperiod interaction. Results: 59 patients were randomized to receive first L-carnitine treatment or placebo and 57 were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Mean age was 45, 74% were women, and median EDSS was 3. At inclusion mean MFIS score was 71.3% (standard deviation [SD] 15.5) and mean FSS was 6.1 (SD 0.8). Adherence to study treatments was good and no significant unexpected adverse event was reported throughout the study. There was no difference in L-Carnitine treatment efficacy versus placebo for the primary end-point (-0.22 points, 95% confidence interval (95%CI)=[-5.80;5.36], p=0,94) and for any of the secondary end-points (FSS: -0.10 points, 95%CI=[-0.45;0.24], p=0,55; Except for VAS: 1.43 points, 95%CI=[0.22;2.65], p=0.02, in favor of placebo). Conclusions: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, Oral L-Carnitine is not effective to treat MS fatigue at the global population level. Further evaluation of patients with carnitine deficiency is ongoing.This study confirms the fact that patient not deficient in carnitine doesn't need any supplementation.",

"Title": "The effect of Fampridine-SR on cognitive fatigue in a randomized double-blind crossover trial in patients with MS",
"Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive fatigue (CF) is a common complaint in persons with MS (PwMS). Fampridine-SR improves ambulation, fatigue and endurance, due to enhancing action potential formation by blocking potassium channels in demyelinated axons. Thus, through this same mechanism, it is hypothesized that Fampridine-SR could improve CF. OBJECTIVE: To determine if Fampridine-SR objectively improves CF in PwMS. METHODS: Sixty PwMS of any type with CF, defined as 3 or less correct responses when comparing the last third to the first third on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), were recruited from a tertiary care MS clinic in London (ON) Canada. Subjects also had to be between 18 and 64 years of age, inclusive, not had a relapse in the last 60 days or corticosteroids in the last 30 days, EDSS 0.0-7.0, and no other diagnosis that could cause cognitive impairment. A randomized double blind crossover design was used: subjects were randomized to either placebo or Fampridine-SR for 4 weeks, then after at least a one week washout, received the opposite treatment. Subjects were assessed before and after each treatment block. The primary outcome was the PASAT CF score after treatment with Fampridine-SR compared to placebo. T-tests and chi-square were used to compare demographics between the two groups (placebo-Fampridine-SR vs. Fampridine SR-placebo). Treatment effects were assessed using factorial ANOVA, with treatment (Fampridine-SR vs. placebo) and time (before and after treatment) as within-subject variables. RESULTS: Of the 60 subjects randomized, 48 completed the study; three were removed due to an adverse event while in the treatment arm (one due to relapse while on placebo, one due to urinary retention and one due to dizziness and headache while on Fampridine-SR). The subjects had a mean age of 46.5Ã‚Â±10.0 years, education of 13.6Ã‚Â±1.9 years, and were diagnosed with MS 10.6Ã‚Â±9.6 years ago. The majority were female (46, 76.7%), had relapsing remitting MS (41, 68.3%) with median EDSS of 3.5 (range 1.0-7.0). There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. The treatment x time interaction within the factorial ANOVA on PASAT CF scores was statistically significant, F(1, 45)=8.28, p=0.006, suggesting there is a difference between the treatments (placebo vs. Fampridine-SR), over the course of the study. An evaluation of the mean scores suggests, however, that subjects saw a greater improvement when they were given the placebo, than when they were given the active medication. Similarly, individuals showed a greater increase in their information processing speed (as measured by the PASAT) over the course of treatment when they were given the placebo, as compared with the active medication F(1,45)=4.17, p=0.047. CONCLUSION: Although this small pilot study does not suggest that Fampridine-SR results in a statistically significant improvement of CF in MS patients, as compared to placebo, individuals demonstrated an improvement in both information processing speed and CF, suggesting further studies are warranted.",

"Title": "Aspirin is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on multiple sclerosis-related fatigue: Data from a randomized controlled trial",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if aspirin (ASA) therapy reduces multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue.BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and often disabling symptom of MS. We previously reported results of a crossover study suggesting that ASA (1300 mg/d) may reduce MS-related fatigue. We designed a parallel-group trial to further evaluate this observation.DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a 3-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial comparing high-dose ASA (1300 mg/d), low-dose ASA (162 mg/d), and placebo. Eligibility criteria included relapsing MS, MS-related fatigue with Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) score >40, and no recent/concurrent use of ASA or NSAIDs. The primary outcome was the total MFIS score (week 8) and the minimum clinically important effect was defined as a 10-point adjusted mean MFIS improvement. The study was designed to block-randomize 135 subjects with centrally allocated and concealed study medication. The primary analysis compared the high-dose ASA group with placebo using ANCOVA.RESULTS: A planned interim analysis evaluated sixty randomized subjects. Six subjects did not receive the intervention and four subjects discontinued without providing follow-up data. 50 subjects were included in the analysis. The adjusted mean MFIS score was 38.1 (high-dose ASA) versus 42.7 (placebo), a difference of 4.6 points (95% CI -2.0 to 11.2, P = 0.16). Bayes posterior probability (non-informative prior probability) was 95% that the mean MFIS difference is <10 points in the target population. A new sample of 280 subjects per group would be required to detect the difference observed in the interim sample. No serious adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: The interim analysis data suggest that ASA (1300 mg/d) is very unlikely to provide clinically significant benefit for MS-related fatigue. We elected to discontinue the study because of the interim results and recruitment challenges.",

"Title": "Evaluating the effects of amantadin, modafinil and acetyl-L-carnitine on fatigue in multiple sclerosis--result of a pilot randomized, blind study",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fatigue affects more than 60% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and is one of the most troublesome symptoms of the disease. Current treatment options for MS fatigue include amantadine, modafinil and acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR). The aim of our study was to compare efficacy of amantadine, modafinil and ALCAR with placebo in patients with MS. METHODS: Patients with MS and a disability level <= 5.5 on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and fatigue were included in the study. Patients were assigned to a one month treatment with either amantadine 200mg, ALCAR 2g, modafinil 200mg or placebo. Efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by using the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS). RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in the study (39 females). The mean age of patients was 38 +/- 6.7 years and the mean disease duration was 6.6 +/- 1.2 years. Contrast analysis showed significantly lower mean MFIS score after one month in patients on amantadine compared to placebo (mean difference=17.3, p=0.001). There was also a trend of a lower MFIS score in ALCAR group in comparison to placebo (mean difference=12.4, p=0.05, with Keppel-corrected alpha of 0.046). The quality of life measured as SF 36 - PCS and SF 36 - MCS proved to be significantly influenced by treatment. CONCLUSION: One month treatment with amantadine improved fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting MS as evaluated by MFIS. No or only a trend of improvement was seen in patients treated with modafinil or ALCAR, respectively. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

"Title": "Ambulation and cognition following treatment with dalfampridine in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "Background: Dalfampridine extended release is a potassiumchannel blocker approved for improving walking in multiple sclerosis (MS). It has recently gained attention as a potential treatment for cognitive impairment, based on a few uncontrolled, observational studies. To date, data support that dalfampridine improves walking in MS, but there are no randomized controlled trials of its co-occurring effects on cognition. Methods: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, Article Citation, 61 patients meeting revised McDonald criteria for MS were enrolled. All participants further met inclusion criteria for cognitive impairment, defined as a z < -1.5 on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). The active arm received 10mg of dalfampridine extended release, bid, and was compared to a placebo group. Excluded were patients receiving steroids in last thirty (30) days or a relapse in the last ninety (90) days prior to enrollment. An extensive battery of tests was administered at baseline and 3 months follow- up, including SDMT, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT2), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMTR), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System-Sorting (DKEFS Sorting), Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), and 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Patient reported outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The effects of treatment were evaluated via mixed factor ANOVA. Results: Treatment effects on the T25FW were replicated, with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.27 for mean change in treatment vs. placebo. In contrast, there were no statistically significant interaction effects on cognitive function, fatigue or depression scores. Using a 20% change threshold, there were no significant interaction effects comparing responders vs. non-responders on any of the cognitive outcomes except PASAT, where responders had significant improvement relative to non-responders. Conclusions: We confirm an effect of dalfampridine on timed ambulation in a placebo-controlled study. However, there were no effects on cognitive performance or self-report scales. Treated patients with a clinically meaningful improvement in ambulation had a benefit on auditory processing speed (PASAT), but no other change on cognitive or PRO outcomes. Thus, beneficial effects of dalfampridine on ambulation do not appear to be associated with gain in the other performance metrics examined.",

"Title": "Treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis: A phase II doubleblind, randomized, mono-center, placebo-controlled crossover-sub-study on prolonged-release fampridine",
"Abstract": "Physical fatigue is a common sequel of multiple sclerosis (MS) with limited treatment options. Previous studies suggested that 4-aminopyridine can serve as symptomatic treatment of fatigue in late MS by increasing synaptic transmission via the blockade of voltage gated potassium channels in demyelinated axons. Goodman et al. (2009, 2010) demonstrated that treatment with fampridine- PR (4-aminopyridine, prolonged-release formula) improved walking performance in subjects with MS. Motor performance can be influenced by fatigue and vice versa, however, this interaction was not studied in these trials. The present sub-study of the investigatorinitiated mono-center trial, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAMPKINÃ¢â‚¬Â (http://clinicaltrials. gov) investigated the effects of fampridine-PR on fatigue as secondary endpoint in subjects with MS including correlations between measures of fatigue and ambulation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with cross-over design was conducted on 61 subjects (55 eligible for analysis) with primary progressive, secondary progressive or relapsing remitting MS. The patients' perception of fatigue was evaluated with a standardized questionnaire (WEIMuS) at baseline and 4 times during the double-blind treatment periods. Changes of sleep duration including afternoon naps were assessed with a sleep diary for approximately 2 weeks (median: 13 days) during the 2 double-blind treatment periods. Walking tests like the Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) were performed at each study visit. Preliminary results from the WEIMuS questionnaire indicated no change of physical fatigue following treatment with fampridine- PR (13 Ã‚Â± 4 of 36 points [pts]; average difference to BL -1.6 pts) compared to placebo treatment (13 Ã‚Â± 4 of 36 pts; average difference to BL -1.5 pts) in the total study population. However, T25FW responders (23 of 55) showed a tendency towards reduced fatigue during treatment with fampridine-PR (average difference to BL -3.0 pts) in comparison to placebo treatment (average difference to BL -0.8 pts; n.s.). Data obtained from sleep diaries demonstrated reduced bed-time duration under fampridine-PR treatment compared to placebo (mean difference 11min.; p = 0.046). In summary, our results suggest that fampridine-PR does not only increase walking speed in a proportion of patients, but may also reduce fatigue. Walking performance assessed under treatment with fampridine- PR should be interpreted against the background of the interaction between physical fatigue and motor function.",

"Title": "Effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There has long been a belief that depression contributes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) although supporting data are minimal at best. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of fatigue include recommendations for the treatment of depression in the absence of clear empirical support. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in MS. METHODS: Sixty patients with a relapsing form of MS and moderate to severe depression were randomly assigned to one of three validated 16-week treatments for depression: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group psychotherapy, or sertraline. Assessments at baseline and treatment cessation included the primary outcome measure, fatigue assessment instrument (FAI), and Beck depression inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The total FAI and the global fatigue severity subscale were significantly reduced over the course of treatment (p values <.02). Other subscales did not change significantly. Secondary analyses showed change in global fatigue severity was associated with change in BDI (p =.03) but change in total FAI was only marginally related to change in BDI (p =.05). These relationships were due entirely to change in mood (p values <.02) and not to change in cognitive or vegetative symptoms (p values >.17). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that treatment for depression is associated with reductions in the severity of fatigue symptoms, and that this relationship is due primarily to treatment related changes in mood.",

"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative efficacy of amantadine, pemoline, and placebo in treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue. BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a complication of MS. Both pemoline and amantadine have been used to treat MS fatigue, but their relative efficacy is not known. METHODS: Amantadine, pemoline, and placebo were compared in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using a parallel-group design. Ninety-three ambulatory MS patients completed the study. Primary outcome measures were the fatigue severity scale (FSS); the MS-specific fatigue scale (MS-FS); and subjective response determined by verbal self-report. Secondary outcome measures consisted of assessments of sleep, depression, and vitality. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with planned post-hoc contrasts and Fisher's exact test were used to compare treatment response. RESULTS: Amantadine-treated patients showed a significantly greater reduction in fatigue, as measured by the MS-FS, than did patients treated with placebo (p = 0.04). By verbal report at the end of the study, 79% of patients treated with amantadine versus 52% treated with placebo and 32% treated with pemoline preferred drug therapy compared with no treatment (p = 0.03). No significant differences in any primary outcome measures were noted between pemoline and placebo. Neither amantadine nor pemoline affected sleep or depression relative to placebo. CONCLUSION: Amantadine was significantly better than placebo in treating fatigue in MS patients, whereas pemoline was not. The benefit of amantadine was not due to changes in sleep, depression, or neurologic disability.",

Fatigue, the effect of fatigue on an individually pre-selected activity and its effect on activities of daily living, were evaluated. Amantadine produced a small but statistically significant decrease in fatigue. An important placebo effect was noted. Mean fatigue during the washout period was lower than during the placebo run-in period, independently of which treatment had been given first. Side effects were numerous both on amantadine and on placebo. Only insomnia was significantly more common with amantadine.",

Design/Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (2013-002558-64 EU Clinical Trials Register), we included patients with cognitive deficit defined through a score in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) under the 10th percentile of reference value for italian population. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Dalfampridine 10 mg or placebo twice daily for 12 consecutive weeks. They underwent the Rao Brief Repeatable Neuropsychological Battery, the Tower of London and the Stroop Test at screening, at the end of treatment (T1) and after a 4 weeks follow-up (T2). At the same time-points we administered the MS Functional Composite, the MS Impact Scale and the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions questionnaires. The primary outcome of the study was the improvement in the SDMT score. Results: Out of 208 patients screened, 120 were randomised (74 women and 46 men, age 48Ã‚Â±8,2 years, disease duration16Ã‚Â±8.88 years, formal education 13Ã‚Â±3,43 years, median EDSS 4.0); baseline characteristics were balanced across groups. At T1, Dalfampridine group presented a higher proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 20% in the SDMT score and a significant higher increase of SDMT scores compared with placebo group (76.1%vs 44% p=0.001, 9.89 vs 4.89 p<0.001 for raw score and 0.46 vs -0.10 p=0.001 for z scores respectively; Linear mixed model with robust standard error). The improvement was not sustained at T2. Data of the secondary outcomes will be also presented. Conclusions: We suggest that Dalfampiridine should be considered as an effective treatment option for cognitive impairment in MS.",

"Title": "Low dose aspirin for MS-related fatigue: Results of a pilot, double-blind, randomized trial",
"Abstract": "Context Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Aims We aimed to evaluate the effects of low dose Aspirin (80 mg) in primary fatigue in MS patients. Settings and design This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind and parallel trial with 1:1 ratio allocation of two treatment groups of low dose Aspirin (80 mg) and placebo in outpatients with MS-related fatigue. Methods and material Treatment strategy was applied for 8 weeks in definitely diagnosed MS patients. Patients were assessed by means of modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS) and fatigue severity scale (FSS). Patients were also evaluated for side effects and tolerability of the drug. Results One hundred and twenty patients with MS were randomized. Among them, 100 patients entered final analysis. No significant effect in FSS and MFIS was found regarding intervention arms using ANOVA for repeated measure. Independent sample T-test, examining absolute changes for FSS score (Endpoint - Baseline), reveals Aspirin supremacy against placebo which was statistically significant. Conclusions Aspirin in 80 mg did not convey a significant difference in either group. However the absolute changes among the two treatment arms appeared meaningful in FSS but not in MFIS. Therefore, the probability of Aspirin effectiveness exists, however it is not provable in repeated measure analysis as a result of substantial drop out and relatively short treatment period.",

"Title": "HAGIL (Hamburg Vigil Study): a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study with modafinil for treatment of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis",
"Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To reassess the effect of modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting artificial psychostimulant, on fatigue and neuropsychological measures in patients with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with a baseline score of >=4 on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score <7 were eligible for the 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Modafinil was dosed up to 200mg/day within 1week. Assessments were performed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome parameter was the mean change of the FSS mean score. Secondary outcome variables were other questionnaires covering fatigue, daytime sleepiness and sleep quality. Cognitive impairment was assessed by the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). RESULTS: The study included 121 MS patients. Dropout rate was 9%. Both treatment groups showed improvements through time. While mean FSS at 8 weeks showed a trend difference between groups in the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary endpoint was not met. Assessment of cognitive impairment by SDMT and PASAT showed contradictory results. All other secondary endpoints were not met. There was no major safety concern. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the study does not support modafinil as an effective treatment for MS fatigue. However, the study shows the need for new Article Citations and endpoints in MS fatigue studies.",
